The Crypt beneath the Tower is an old and decrepit place. Much of it hasn't been used in years--the only part that remains in use is the Chapel of the Cycladenes. Since the disappearance of the three apprentices, most of the Crypts have been blocked off by rubble.
The Blocked Wing is a forsaken section of Zagyg's Tower, housing the crypt where the tragic fate of three students unfolded. Over the years, it has become a labyrinthine dungeon filled with undead, dark magic, and secrets.

>[!Question] DM's Thoughts
>How am I engaging all of my players in this Dungeon?
>Druid, Ranger, Wizard, Fighter, Paladin
>1. The Paladin and Fighter get to punch things.
>2. The Wizard gets lots of arcana checks.
>3. The Druid and Ranger are new--they'll be picking up skills and learning how the game works.
>	1. Druid can help with Arcana, spells, and healing (maybe). Nature checks can also identify the **Darkmantle**.
>	2. The Ranger can track creatures through the Dungeon--he'll be able to know through a **DC 10 Survival** that there is probably only one creature often moving around through the Dungeon. Further, it seems to magically warp the ground around it. Further, Ranger can punch things.

>[!note] A note on Loot
>Loot collected throughout a dungeon is pooled into a communal Loot Sack. The party can decide what happens to that loot at the end of the dungeon.

#### Level 1 - the Upper Crypt

>[!todo]- (A) Entrance Hall
> The entrance to the Crypt is hidden behind a disheveled tapestry. It is a dimly lit room lined with crumbling stone and flickering torches.

>[!todo]- (B) Cycladene Chapel
>A spacious, beautifully decorated chapel space dedicated to the Cycle of Twins. Two half-circle bastions jut out from the sides. One is tiled in white mosaic, the other in black. The room in between is covered in dizzying geometric patterns and swirls. Shadows gather near the candles at the White shrine, emphasizing their other-worldly presence. Some shadows slip into a crack in the wall towards the back of the Chapel.

#### Level 2

>[!todo]- (G) Trapped sarcophogi
>Three home-made traps are hidden by these sarcophogi. They are rigged with arcane traps, but it seems easy enough to disable if you know what you're doing.
>
>>[!warning] Magical traps
>>1. Rune of Paralyzation: **DC 10 to find, DC 15 arcana to disable**; affects all targets within 10 ft., **DC 11 CON save** or become paralyzed for 1d4 rounds;

>Passing the traps awards **300 XP**

>[!todo]- (H) Sewage Pond

>[!todo]- (I) Whispering Corridor
>A corridor filled with shifting Shadows. Another crack in the wall here eminates a whispering voice.

>>[!warning] Illusionary Door
>>**DC 14 Percep** to notice it, it leads to **(J) Secret Corridor**

>A door at the end of the hall leads to **(K) Sacrifice Room**.

>[!todo]- (J) Secret Corridor
>This secret corridor features stairs that lead up to the **(F) Old Storage Room** and two illusionary doors that lead to **(I) Whispering Corridor** and  **(L) Forgotten Archive**. Both of these illusiary doors are transparent from this side.

>[!todo]- (K) Sacrifice Room
>A chamber walled with enchanted mirrors that reflect disturbing images of the PCs.
>
>>[!warning] Mirrored Doorway
>>In one of the mirrors you can notice (**DC 15 Percep**) that a door is shown that you can't naturally see. If you feel around that area of the wall, you can feel a handle and open the invisible room. Other mirrors are trapped and shatter when touched (attack roll of +2, 1d4 damage).
>>>[!example] Loot
>>>a letter of correspondence, a platinum coin wrapped in a crude map, a small lodestone. The letter is to a mysterious **~T~** who says **"I will describe the ritual to you at our meeting. Do not write it down. Do not tell or show anyone"**. The map reveals the hidden doorway to **(J) the Secret Corridor** and to the **Forgotten Archive (L)**. The platinum coin is ancient, from old Shada, and might be worth 15 gp. It is a key for the Moving Bookcase doorway in **(L) Forgotten Archive**.
>
>A magical ritual took place here--evidence of spell materials, incense, a magical diagram. A bloody mess surround the ritual--a sacrifice, or something worse?
>
>>[!warning] Magical Ritual
>>**DC 15 Arcana** check will reveal that whatever ritual was being performed, it certainly went awry. **DC 18 Arcana** check reveals this was a lich creation ritual.
>
> An archway at the far side of this room leads down to Level 3, **(O) Forgotten Crypt**..

>[!todo]- (L) Forgotten Archive
>An ancient, forgotten archive. It seems like the room was ransacked. Dusty and weathered tomes are scattered on the floor. Now indecipherable, they may have once held knowledge of long-lost rituals and spells. Delicate scrolls with faded ink sit in an alcove in one wall. They seem to be ancient annals describing the early activities of the Tower.
>One scrolls, written in Shadaean, seems to be an ancient correspondence from the High Wizardead to the Emperor himself requesting the acquisition of several hundred shades and wraiths.
>A series of cryptic runes are etched onto the floor.
>>[!warning] Cryptic Runes
>>**DC 12 arcana** will tell you that these runes were a glyph of warding at one point--carved as practice by the three missing apprentices in case something ``went wrong''. The glyph is defunct now, but it looks like with a little bit of smarts it can be repaired (**DC 15 arcana**). If repaired, the Glyph will cast Hold Person (**DC 15** on the first hostile thing that enters it).
>
>In one of the piles of books you find what seem to be lab notes from the apprentices, Desi, Nedavir, and Rashil. They recount the collection of ingredients and talk about their desire to enter lichdom.
>
>There are some minor pieces of loot that you find hidden in the nooks and crannies if you search:
>>[!example] Loot
>>250 cp, a bloodstone cup engraved with arcane runes (25 gp), a bone medallion engraved with a labyrinth (25 gp), a linen mantle threaded with copper (25 gp), a marble rod engraved with a labyrinth (25 gp), a silver ring inlaid with a filigree of electrum (25 gp), Figurine of Wondrous Power (golden lions) (rare, dmg 169).
>>Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
>
>
>>[!warning] Sliding Bookshelf
>>**DC 13 Percep** reveals that the back bookcase is false--but it's locked. A small inset in the frame might be a keyhole, but its shallow and circular, shaped like a large coin. This leads to Level 3, **(Q) Ned's Room**.

>[!todo]- (M) Piss stream
>The smelly stream flows down from **(H)) Sewage Pond**. It winds downward, growing more cramped as you go.
>>[!warning] Hidden Tunnel
>>**DC 13 Perception** to find  a tight cave branching off that spirals deeper. It leads down to Level 3, to **Fraz's chamber (N)**

#### Level 3

>[!todo]- (N) Fraz's Chamber
>This chamber is blocked by a magical ward -- it seems impenetrable. Light streams from under the door, 
>>[!warning] Deciphering the Ward
>>**DC 13 arcana** The ward script is written in a mix of cryptic Tanorian and has secondary wards in Draconic.

>[!todo]- (O) Forgotten Crypt.
>A large, multi-level crypt with opulent sarcophogi. The inscriptions tell of past Wizardheads, Witcheads, and powerful Warlocks. Professors from hundreds of years ago.
>
>As soon as you enter, you see something lurking in the shadows. If it sees you **(Passive perception of 10)** a writhing mass of flesh, eyes, and mouths screeches and awakens a few guardian skeletons. It flees down a hallway.
>
>>[!danger] Fighting Ned
>>Ned will attempt to escape, rather than fight. He will flee up to **(D) the Main Crypt**, where he will awaken more skeletons. He'll make his stand there, but will attempt to stand down and call for peace if dropped to 10 HP. He will explain his plight and call for mercy.
>>
>>If the PCs **let Ned live**, Taforayesh will acknowledge that he wouldn't live outside the Tower. He will become new Crypt Warden, and his job will be cleaning up the Blocked Wing and opening the other closed parts of the Crypts. If allowed to live, as a sign of good spirits, Ned will give each PC 20 GP from his tuition and turn the rest in. The PCs will still get 450 XP for dealing with Ned.
>>
>>If the PCs choose to **kill Ned**, they can have full choice among his loot--though they are still expected to turn in any enormous sums, like tuition funds, to Hasur Highfallow. The tuition funds will be used to hire a cleric to cleanse the crypts and clean them up over the next few months.

>[!todo]- (P) Ned's room
>A vile pit of garbage and refuse, this seems to be where the creature has been living. Rat skeletons fill the corners, and piles of books and manuscripts lay stuck together by mucus.
>
>>[!example] Ned's tuition
>>In one pile, it seems that Ned has been collecting stuff--including a small chest that contains a note from his father and tuition money for one year -- 800 gp! You know that, technically, you should turn that money in to the Tower.
>>Outline of the note: "Nedavir, Here is an allotment of coin to pay for the provisioned lectures for this year. I haven't heard from you in some time--and if I don't hear from you soon, then this will be the final payment I send. I am not going to support an eloped offspring when this money would be better spent on your siblings. - Father"

>>Beside the note is a paper half scratched with a reply, but it seems the creature lost most of its ability to write or focus. The scratchings are raving.
>
>>[!example] Trove
>>2300 cp, 30 gp, a bone scepter engraved with spirals (25 gp), a jasper cup engraved with a labyrinth (25 gp), a pewter crown etched with draconic runes (25 gp), a stoneware tile adorned with silver and a coat of arms in relief (25 gp), an ivory medallion inlaid with a meandros of electrum (25 gp), Dust of Disappearance (uncommon, dmg 166), Potion of Water Breathing (uncommon, dmg 188), Stick of Inigo (uncommon, dmg 211)
>>
>>Stick of Inigo: *A plain wooden stick, carved with ``Property of Inigo'' at its base* 
>>3 charges. If a secret door is within 30 ft of you, you can hold out the Stick and it will give you advantage on detecting the door. It regains 1d3 charges every dawn.

#### Scene 3 - Tidying up

If the PCs **let Ned live**, Taforayesh will acknowledge that he wouldn't live outside the Tower. He will become new Crypt Warden, and his job will be cleaning up the Blocked Wing and opening the other closed parts of the Crypts. If allowed to live, as a sign of good spirits, Ned will give each PC 20 GP from his tuition and turn the rest in. The PCs will still get 450 XP for dealing with Ned.

If the PCs choose to **kill Ned**, they can have full choice among his loot--though they are still expected to turn in any enormous sums, like tuition funds, to Hasur Highfallow. The tuition funds will be used to hire a cleric to cleanse the crypts and clean them up over the next few months.

The PCs get their monthly wage of 30 gp as payment.

Total XP needed for level: 300x5 = 1500.
Total XP needed for level 3: 600x5 = 3000
Estimated XP: 450 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 400 + 200 + 100 + 300 + 150 = ~1750. Probably ~2000 with Scene 1.
