 The Pilot adventure.
Goals:
- Get introduced to the Tower, some of its mysteries, and some NPCs.
- Investigate the **Blocked Wing** of the Crypt. A trio of students went down there some time ago and never returned. What were they doing? Are they still down there?
	- Three students (Desi, Nedavir, and Rashil) attempted to become liches. Their rituals went awry, and combined them all into a mutant Flesh Golem called "Ned", as it seems Nedavir's mind is more forward. The Flesh Golem only speaks as a collective, "we". Ned has been surviving on rats and other small creatures, is heavily influenced by "The Voice in the Walls" (Fraz) that tells him to do horrible things. Ned blocked themselves into the Blocked Wing to prevent further damage and to try to continue their studies, though they can't cast spells anymore. Ned is frightened of outsiders discovering their mistake, and so they send their undead minions to deal with the Crew, but will try to talk to them if they make it to his chamber.
