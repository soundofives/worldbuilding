Deep in the night, on 24 Ithalary, [[Mirol the Starwatcher]] rushes back to the Tower after observing a lunar eclipse from a tower in Bonz. He has seen, divined in the stars, a horrible prophecy sent by the goddess Cathorin.
>[!warning] The Vision
>*A scene of the Candle Crown hewn by a shadowy greatsword,*
>**In the grasp of the Deepness Gloam, the Candle King a Black Blade mourns,**
>*A flashing scene of a tome, hands reaching toward it as it flips open, the vision spiraling into it.*
>**Blade Black as the Unhallowed Tome, Six by six by six its pages shorn, fate unwound to the hollow bone.**

**Blade Black as the Unhallowed Tome, Six by six by six its pages shorn, fate unwound to the hollowed bone.**
**In the grasp of the Deepness Gloam, the Candle King a Black Blade mourns,**
He grabs Zagyg in the middle of the night and drags him to the quarters of all the mercenaries. He awakes everyone and gathers them.

>[!quote] Mirol the Starwatcher
>**"Zagyg, I'm telling you, if this is true, then it cannot wait. I will contact the others. We'll send the senior Crew to the ruins at Glimmerfor and the new members south to Stardale."**
>
>**"Crew, this night Cathorin has revealed to me a divination that I would rather not believe. However, if it is true, then great changes are ahead. I need your immediate aid in confirming this vision. I have marked out two ruins that may contain ancient prophetic records that could corroborate what I saw. Take these materials..."**
>**"...and return with scrolls, tomes, or carving rubs that might, hopefully, prove me wrong. Mott, you lead your Crew away to the Glimmerfor. There should be ruins nearby the city there. It's a long journey--if we have moved when you return, await us in the City. You, Maximo, take your Crew to the nearby ruins of Stardale. Follow the south road to the edge of Torringfell Forest, then head east to the hills for three days. The town is small, but it should be marked by signs. Take Saamy here with you--she's a novice in divination, but she should be able to help recognize what's important. Now, be off in haste. And find me upon your return."**
>
 
>[!note] The Quest
>In order to confirm the divination, Mirol needs ancient prophetic records, celestial readings from eons past. If the divination he just interpreted was true, the ancient diviners might have seen it first and had enough time to predict a trend. Mirol needs the records of the many lives of Iyana and Atena, the greatest diviners of myth and the twins who carried the legacy of Krinica through the Red Sun, to confirm the truth behind the prophecy. He has a clue where such records could be found: in some ruins nearby, outside the small town of Stardale.
>
>**Instructions:** take the south road to the edge of the Torringfell Forest, then head east for three days into the hills.

#### Stardale is in trouble.

***What they know:***
A Troll has moved into a forest nearby. A traveler moved to the town around the same time, a young girl, and was able to help them stave off its anger. They sacrifice livestock to keep it fed, but the troll's influence in the surroundings seems to be growing stronger. The forest is warping and turning to swamp, and it is growing darker and foggier.

***What's actually happening:***
A Hag, Olga the Wicked, has been watching the town of Stardale for some time. Long ago, she was cast out as a witch and forced through the secluded fairy ring into the Feywild--but not a nice side of the Feywild. She was corrupted by a powerful Night Hag and has returned for her revenge. She moved to Stardale some years ago, slowly biding her time and earning the trust of those around her. Recently, she pulled a troll through the fairy ring and set it upon the town, forcing their reliance as she suggested feeding it livestock. Soon enough, she'll suggest they feed it children.

***More details of the situation:***
The town elders of Stardale are demon worshipers at the head of a (mostly) town-wide cabal to Orcus (actually Fraz, but they don't know that). They have been studying the archives of the Stardale Ruins and passing their information back off to their patron. This is how Yrah knew about the prophecy and eclipse. The cabal performs many of their unholy rituals in the Ruins as well, using a secret entrance rather than the front, which is protected by ancient guardians.
Several centuries back, when Fraz first started corrupting this town, he radicalized them to the worship of Orcus. They underwent a witch hunt in which Olga was exiled.

#### Layer 1. The Town

##### Node A. Around the Town
The PCs arrive in the local town where the archive is rumored to be located. It becomes quickly evident that something isn't right in this town: the people are sick and hungry, the atmosphere is dismal. Anyone in the town will tell the adventurers that they've been forced to give up livestock to a troll that's taken the nearby forest as its home. They've been slowly going hungry ever since.

>M. Hem Bakal
>M. Luvomor Jovan
>M/F. Saam Stravkor
>F. Vesilya Debilas
>F. Nada Mitrey
>M. Borlaw Aslan
>F. Tess Adulay

- Clue 1: A local mentions the existence of the Stardale Ruins and suggests asking the town's elders (leads to **Node B**).
- Clue 2: A cryptic symbol drawn on an elder's house wall hints at a  hidden entrance to the archive (leads to the secret passage into **Node F** through the **Secret Passageway**).
- Clue 3: Overhearing a conversation near the bridge, the party learns about cultist activity in the area; "Desper wants to have a meeting tonight. We'll gather behind the Meeting Hall at dusk." (leads to **Node C**).
- Clue 4: One woman, in hushed tones, can be convined to reveal that she believes the Troll is a curse placed on Stardale by Kalrul for their heretical worship. (leads to **Node C**)

One woman, who goes by Olga, seems out of place. She is gruff but lean, seemingly a forester armed with a bow. She explains that she's been in town for some time and offers advice about how to stave off the Troll's hunger.
Olga offers to show the Crew to the archives. 

![[stardale.png]]

##### Node B. The Elders
The town elders are suspicious of travelers, but they'll welcome any help they can get to deal with the Troll. They'll get everyone in the village to chip in and can offer 250 gold as a reward.

The Elders are the heads of the cult of Orcus, but they keep their involvement quiet. They warn the adventurers to keep away from the Ruins, as they are haunted.

If the Crew heavily interrogates (probably magically) the Elders, they can find the truth about the Cult.

Clues to adjacent nodes:
- Clue 1: An elder tells of an old guardian construct rumored to protect the archive (leads to **Node E**).
- Clue 2: One elder recommends the Crew stay with them in their house for the night, as there is no tavern (leads to **Node A**).
- Clue 3: If any elder is violently interrogated, charmed, or deceived, they will tell the Crew about the cult gathering "festival" (leads to **Node D**).

##### Node C. Torringfell Forest

Upon approaching the forest, a **Grinning Cat** named [[Barney Bigglesworth]] appears to them.
>[!quote] Voice prompt:
>Cheshire cat, deep flamboyant

He explains that a Troll has taken up resident in his forest. He'd like help getting it removed, and will reward the Crew with 1d4 whiskers, which have magical powers: *ability to cast Misty Step* once.

The forest seems corrupted, swampy, desolate, and smells of sulfur and blood.

As you venture deeper, these features grow stronger--and the more fey-like properties of the Night Forest also grow.

The Troll's lair is in a foggy cave (lightly obscured, disadvantage on perception) and deep in the Night Forest (dark), which gives players without Darkvision *blindness*. They need some sort of light. There is a ruined house, **Olga the Wicked**'s lair, next to it. It is set up in a haggy sort of way, with a bubbling cauldron in its center. Other stuff:
>[!example]- Olga's House
>1. Ankheg Ichor (Potion): After drinking this bitter potion, your appearance changes to become slightly more insect-like, and you gain the ability to use an action to spit acid in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After using this ability, roll a d6. If you roll a 6, you regain the use of the ability. Otherwise, the effect ends.
>2. Bagpipes of Invisibility (Wondrous Item): While playing this musical instrument, you can use an action to turn invisible for 1 round. You become visible if you stop playing, make an attack, or cast a spell.
>3. Assassin's Bracer (Wondrous Item, requires attunement): While wearing this fell bracer, you can use an action to speak its command word. The bracer severs your hand, dealing 1d4 damage to you, and animates it as an undead crawling claw (MM 44). The creature acts on its own initiative count and follows your mental commands. You can return your hand by holding it to your arm and using an action to speak the command word again.
>4.  Scroll of Nightmare Terrain (Scroll): You can use an action to read this scroll and make natural terrain within a 150-foot cube centered on you look, sound, and smell like a field of gallows filled with hanging corpses. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance. The illusion lasts until the next dawn.
>5. Tangle Bug (Potion): This potion flask contains a single small, beetle-like insect altered by alchemy. After it is released from the flask, the bug exists for exactly 1 minute. The bug moves 10 feet per round to a point you specify, then explodes into a 20 foot square of grasping tendrils. If the bug takes any damage, it explodes immediately. For the remainder of the duration, these tendrils turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
>6. Scroll of Rage (Scroll): This hide parchment is inscribed with oaths and invocations of primal ferocity. You can use an action to read it and enter a barbarian rage (phb 48).
>7. The Hellish Articles of Throri: This compendium is bound in leather. It is sealed by fell wards, and cannot be opened by a good person. This spellbook contains the spells Comprehend Languages, False Life, Ice Knife, Phantasmal Force, Shatter, and Suggestion.

The Troll is eating livestock in its lair, and will attack on sight if approached.

If the Crew is led to the lair by **Olga the Wicked**, she calls to the Troll and attack the players out in the open. She begins by using her Stagnant Miasma to force a lot of saving throws and scatter the Crew. Her Troll seeks one at a time while she builds up TP with weaker actions until using Hurl to Earth and spending her TP.
If she falls to 10 HP she tries to bargain with the PCs--spilling all the details about her past and the demon worship of the town. She says that she's doing *good* and that the Crew should help her. She'll offer to lead them into the Archives.

Up to 5 minion peasants can be convinced to join the Crew on the Troll Hunt. They focus on the Troll, but will probably be killed by the Miasma.

##### Aside: the Secret Passageway

On the side of the Atrium, hidden among a facade of leaves (**DC 15 to spot**), a mysterious symbol is hatched into the stone. The same symbol is hatched into the wood of the Elder's house.

**DC 12 Arcana, Religion**: This is a symbol reminiscent of that used by some demon cults you've heard of.
**DC 15 Arcana, Religion**: The symbol is that of Orcus, Demon Lord of Undeath

The Symbol marks the Secret Passageway, a former escape route of the ancient celestial scholars. It is a mechanical entrance, not truly meant to be opened from the outside. Evidence of forcing can be seen, clueing you in on how to open it. A few loose bricks can be pulled from the wall, and with them out of the way a stone door can be swung open.

##### Node D. The Bloodlord's Cult

The cult gathers outside the meeting hall, then does a promenade up to the Ruins. They enter through the Secret Passage and perform a ritual on a corpse. They drain its blood into bowls, light candles, recite liturgy, feast on its flesh, recite more liturgy, enter estatic prayer, perform ritual dances/movements, drink the blood, recite liturgy, etc. This is dedicated to Orcus, the Bloodlord, Demon Lord / God of the Undead.

If interrupted, they try to take the Crew hostage and ritually sacrifice them.

If the Crew goes to fight the Troll before discovering the truth of the cult, the Crew are kidnapped in their beds in a skill challenge and taken to the ritual. The Elders had no intention of paying the Crew--but they did intent to give their god Orcus new sacrifices.

Cult encounter: 2 CR 2 cult leaders, 8 cult minions. Hard encounter.

##### Node E. The Ruin Guardians

Haunting sounds, like chimes or strings subtly vibrating in the wind, echoes throughout the area. The noise is discordant and uneasy.

The Archive Ruins are overgrown. The architecture is ancient, though close inspection shows that it may be even more ancient than it seems--layers have been rebuilt several times, with varying degrees of stone decay and dilapidation present on the outside of the ruins. The building has a decently sized rectangular atrium that leads to a large semicircular hall at the back. There are no windows, though the top of the Celestial Observatory is open.

The front doorway is a large stonework door guarded by a massive statue of a woman dressed in ancient armor. She stands off to the side of the door, opposite her a similar statue once stood, but is nowhere to be found. (She, many years ago, had tried to chase down Heward the Bard, one of the Company of Seven. He made his way inside to investigate the Star Lyre. He dropped his Handy Haversack in a rush to escape, sending the Guardian toppling off the top of the tower.)

When approaching the door, the Guardian proclaims in a powerful voice in *Archaic Heavenly Sinisar*:
>[!quote] Guardian
>**"Step away from the door. Enter, and face the penalty of annihilation."**

The door is magically locked, but Saamy knows Knock and can unlock it. Doing so will begin a Hard skill challenge to get in and out of the archives and get all the rubbings necessary while distracting or evading the Stone Golem. The chase can include the Atrium and the entryway to the several rooms in the lower level of the Celestial Observatory that rises into the Tower section. Entering the Tower section will allow the Crew to close off the Stone Golem through a magically locked door, though they'll have to find another way out. If they enter and leave without going into the Tower (they find the secret passage), then they'll realize they don't have the full story. They're missing some key data and need to go back in.

Some skill challenge events:

Part 1:
*On failure, they take damage from the Golem*
**The Golem stomps around, they have to dodge the attacks.
The Golem slams the pillar, beginning a collapse!**
Part 2:
Blocks threaten to crush the players on failure.

##### Node F. The Archives

A haunting sound echoes throughout the Archives, caused by the Star Lyres in the Tower.

The Archives have three parts: the main hall, the vault, and the tower. Each location has clues and carvings to get rubbings of.

**The Main Hall**:
1. Entrance chamber. Dusty, decrepit, dark. The square room has two of its corners dedicated to scroll storage, now all disintegrated, and the other full wall dedicated to an elaborate carving. The carving is not the original one created by Iyana and Atena--this one was created when the Observatory was occupied millennia later during the Plane Race. Despite this time difference, the Krinican ideals of reincarnation allows the carving to roughly outline the history of the world as viewed by Iyana and Atena:
	1. The Red Sun disaster, the current state of the world in which the first carvings were made
	2. The arrival of the first Men and Fey
	3. Classical kingdoms
	4. Plane Race
	5. (Prophesized Great Collapse, Black Sword Motif)
	6. (Prophesized coming of the Four Gates of the sinisar empire and rise of Heavenly Sinisar Empire)
	7. (Prophesized "Expansion" (the conquest of sinisa by Dead King))
	8. (Distant, quiet, prophesied Second Disaster, Black Sword Motif)

If in a rush, the Crew can find 3 Clues in this room.

2. Ruined living quarters, long since looted and ruined. Old, rickety wooden tablet shelves still laden with broken clay tablets stand on either side of the door--it looks like a strong shove could collapse them. A few piles of rubble from the ceiling litter the floor.
The tablets, if searched, can offer 2 Clues: one stack, seemingly by a single obsessed observer, repeatedly mentions divinations of the "coming Darkness, Infinite, slowly approaching". The writings seem to be confused, often mentioning a "collection of bound tablets"

A sealed doorway blocks the next chamber and the entrance to the tower. The door can be lockpicked with Slight of Hand and Thieves Tools (Muck, if he attempts this, gets advantage for secret recall of rogueish abilities). It can be broken down with **DC 18** Strength or Athletics.

3. The High Master's quarters. The ancient residence of the two master Astronomers. The room is a living space that doubles as a study, mostly filled with rubble and overgrown plants. One wall is set with clay, though parts of it have fallen off revealing several laminations and layers, each carved completely with inscriptions and drawings.
This wall, if each layer is studied, can offer 3 Clues, each pointing to a minor divination, a small signal that kept repeating about the threat / danger, a King of Light, and the number six.

##### Node G. The Celestial Observatory

Phase spider encounter!

1 phase spider 3 mini spiders. Hard encounter.

The phase spiders stick to the Tower, mainly catching rats, birds, and other animals. The cultists have learned to avoid this area, and if it comes to it, they'll try to lure the Crew into that area and barricade the door.

The top of the celestial observatory has two Star Lyres used by the original astronomers to conduct their divinations. The Lyres attune to the celestial sphere, resonating and harmonizing in specific ways to astral phenomena. The Lyres, often perturbed by the wind, echo a haunting tune about the ruins. This tune, which resonates into the nearby Feywild, attracted the Phase Spiders.

**DC 15 History**: "The Astronomers would play to the stars, and the stars would sing back, singing to them of the path that they see far ahead."

**DC 15 Arcana**: An arcane energy floats from the strings of the Lyres--it seems that the music from them is not bound to this plane. It may have attracted the extraplanar Spiders.

The Lyres can be played (**DC 12 Performance**, each)to calm the spiders temporarily, as if charmed, but both Lyres need to be played. The Lyres can also charm the Stone Guardian.

>[!example] Loot
>Heward's Handy Haversack sits against one of the Star Lyres, old and covered in dust. A few notes inside hint at its ownership and Heward's goals here.
>Other things in the Haversack: 1000 gold pieces, a rabbitskin timmed coat, dusty red liquid potion flecked with metal (Potion of Greater Healing), a bottle of valuable dry white wine from "Cairn of Lyzandred, from your good Pal Zagyg",  a pipe of the Pied Piper (Pipe of the Sewers), a modified Quiver of Elhonna (normal quiver that also allows you to use 1 +2 ammunition per short rest), rope of mending

Maximo - sword, wine
Rabbit - tome
Carric - money and potion
Koshi - rope of mending?
Muck - quiver
Mysto - pipe of the sewers
##### Node H. The Basement

Two **Horde Ghouls** roam the basement.

The secret entrance leads to an underground basement chamber. It seems to be mostly looted. Piles of rubble have been moved off to the side here.
A chamber off to the side has a ladder that leads up, but a sign is hung on its rungs saying "Do not climb"

A room across the stairwell is an ancient temple chamber repurposed to be a temple of Orcus. Its walls are covered in blood and the room is scattered with the bones of the recently, and not so recently, dead. Bones are cracked and the marrow is sucked out.

The cultists come here to perform their ritual.

The tablet storage area, now flooded with dirty groundwater, has several tablets you can find that mention things relevant, possibly, to the prophecy. ie. Eclipse records and prophetic estimations. Eclipse counts show that the current eclipse that just happened should align with a prophetic reveal.


---
XP after this mission: each player has total 3500. (6500 to lvl 5)



Extended content:
Koshi wants to research the possible connection between Orcus' cult, the prophecy, and the black blade.
Orcus' cults spiked in power and frequency after Fraz was ousted--so about 212 years ago.



Muck's timeline:

True timeline: He's been cursed for slightly over 200 years. For those two centuries he was passed around from master to master, eventually spending quite a lot of time under the yoke of the Thief.
What Yrah wants him to believe: Muck has been cursed for 

Fraz's timeline as Yrah: been in prison for 192 years, so spent maybe 10-20 years in Abysm learning stuff and getting powerful.
Yrah's timeline: went to Abyss just over 200 years ago, was cursed, then was taken by Demogorgon and imprisoned in Abysm. He's still there.


Yrah and Muck left for the Abyss 215 years ago.
Hollow Heart got sacked 212 years ago (Fraz has actually been in prison 212 years)
Fraz-Yrah says he spent 20 years in Abysm
Fraz-Yrah says he's been in prison for 192 years
