Deep in the night, on 24 Ithalary, [[Mirol the Starwatcher]] rushes back to the Tower after observing a lunar eclipse from a tower in Bonz. He has seen, divined in the stars, a horrible prophecy sent by the goddess Cathorin. 
>[!warning] The Vision
>*A scene of the Candle Crown hewn by a shadowy greatsword,*
>**In the grasp of the Deepness Gloam, the Candle King a Black Blade mourns,**
>*A flashing scene of a tome, hands reaching toward it as it flips open, the vision spiraling into it.*
>**Blade Black as the Unhallowed Tome, Six by six by six its pages shorn, fate unwound to the hollow bone.**

He grabs Zagyg in the middle of the night and drags him to the quarters of all the mercenaries. He awakes everyone and gathers them.

>[!quote] Mirol the Starwatcher
>**"Zagyg, I'm telling you, if this is true, then it cannot wait. I will contact the others. We'll send the senior Crew to the ruins at Glimmerfor and the new members south to Stardale."**
>
>**"Crew, this night Cathorin has revealed to me a divination that I would rather not believe. However, if it is true, then great changes are ahead. I need your immediate aid in confirming this vision. I have marked out two ruins that may contain ancient prophetic records that could corroborate what I saw. Take these materials..."**
>**"...and return with scrolls, tomes, or carving rubs that might, hopefully, prove me wrong. Mott, you lead your Crew away to the Glimmerfor. There should be ruins nearby the city there. It's a long journey--if we have moved when you return, await us in the City. You, Maximo, take your Crew to the nearby ruins of Stardale. Follow the south road to the edge of Torringfell Forest, then head east to the hills for three days. The town is small, but it should be marked by signs. Take Saamy here with you--she's a novice in divination, but she should be able to help recognize what's important. Now, be off in haste. And find me upon your return."**
>
 
>[!note] The Quest
>In order to confirm the divination, Mirol needs ancient prophetic records, celestial readings from eons past. If the divination he just interpreted was true, the ancient diviners might have seen it first. Mirol needs the records of the many lives of Iyana and Atena, the greatest diviners of myth and the twins who carried the legacy of Krinica through the Red Sun, to confirm the truth behind the prophecy. He has a clue where such records could be found: in some ruins nearby, outside the small town of Stardale.
>
>**Instructions:** take the south road to the edge of the Torringfell Forest, then head east for three days into the hills.

The journey is peaceful and warm, but after you turn towards the hills you pass over a ridge that looks down into a seemingly mystical swamp.

This is a Night Swamp, similar to the Night Forest on the Tower grounds. At the center is a small Feywild astral injunction, through which a smiling cat passed through and made his home. Recently, a troll has wandered through and made a mess of everything. The smiling cat hangs around the road nearby in case anyone passing by can help. It offers 1d4 whiskers for the PCs help.
