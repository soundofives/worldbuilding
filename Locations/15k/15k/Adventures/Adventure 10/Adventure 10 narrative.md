Stuff that isn't in Aventure 9:

If the Crew goes back to the Tower, the injunction with the Infinite Fear has gotten stronger. An injunction into their minds begins. It begins with:
Their nightmare: (describe this)
Drown in Death (Concentration). One creature within
120 feet that is in Dim Light or Darkness must
succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall into
its shadow (escape DC 21). A creature that fails this
save by 5 or more cannot hold its breath.
While in its shadow, a creature is Blinded, cannot
breathe, and takes 45 (10d8) necrotic damage at the
end of each of its turns. A creature that ends its turn in
its shadow while afflicted with a Curse of Doom ceases
to exist and can't be revived by any means short of a
Wish spell.

Then, in their psychic weakness, the corrupted form of Milo infiltrates their minds and attacks. The landscape is the same place she died, partially flooded, not filling up any higher.


If the Crew asks Borlaw Duskivaine about Inspector Jeffers:

>[!quote] Borlaw Duskivaine
>Yeah...he's not our guy. Not with the Cycladene's either, far as we can tell. Just...a guy doing his job. Don't let him get too much on you. We don't want you getting arrested, and messing with an official investigation can get messy.



1. One of the Young Devils was the deviant son of an aristocrat (son, Danoris Marin, mother Liliana)--they refuse to believe the kid was actually a part of the gang. Rather, they believe he was kidnapped. The people that slaughtered them all should face the penalty of murder: hanging until dead.
2. Further, the Duskivaines frame them for the arson of various churches. Jeffer's doesn't reveal this one at first. He wants to play the long game--first he'll see if they turn themselves in. His job is to convict them of a crime infront of the judges. This takes evidence--even circumstantial evidence--especially for mercenaries who are understood to walk the line of law and crime.
