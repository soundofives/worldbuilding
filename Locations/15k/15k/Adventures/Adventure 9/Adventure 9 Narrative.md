Rabbitouille, Carric, Koshi
Rabbitouille: Arcane Grimoire
Carric: ioun stone of protection (+1 AC)
Koshi: 2 greater healing potions (4d4+4)

## Scene A
1. Borlaw Duskivaine (nee Mirema), Second Life of Tomlaw, a Bank of Miros tough man, pays the business a visit. He says some guards, bureaucracy inspectors (all in the pockets of the Cycladenes), and the region's alchemy guild master are coming to check for licensure--on penalty of imprisonment. Layla will not react well if she learns that the Crew is not licensed. She'll freak out a little--but will not jeapordize the Crew. She has gotten close to Mysto, and thus trusts him enough to believe that this is some misunderstanding (at first).
2. Crew is either a) pursued for imprisonment OR b) they get to talk further with the Bank rep.

a) The 1) Inspector, 1) Mage, and 5) Guards attempt to arrest the Crew on the spot, but will pursue them and start a chase scene. Inspectors use a bolas as part of the chase.
	It will be difficult to deceive or persuade the guards into letting the Crew off. They are being paid by the Cycladenes and are generally not looking to actually enforce the law--they want the Crew gone.
XP: 2000 per player; 10,400 -> 12,400. 14000 to lvl 6.

b) The Rep explains:
1. The Bank cuts public ties with the Crew.
2. The Bank stops giving 300 gp / month.
3. You've pissed off the Cycladenes too much. The Bank can no longer do business with you.

4. A new deal. The Bank wants your business to continue--larger than ever. We want you to focus your sales on Mercs and Law students, selling left overs individually.
5. New contracts require that you cannot get licensed--the recipe cannot be publicly produced. This will require forgery to move bulk shipments through Gates. The Bank provides contacts to a skilled Forger.
6. The Bank takes 0%.
7. In 5 months, you must be producing 200 potions per month.
8. The Bank offers safety. If the High Alchemists in the Guild start to go sniffing, the Bank will take care of it or warn the Crew. Further, a vault will be provided for the Crew to safeguard their earnings.
9. You have connections in the Tower...have you heard of any prophecy going around? Do you have details?
	1. A threat to the LFC is a threat to the bank's investments. People won't pay back loans in a demon invasion.

To meet up with the forger: go to Shadowmark Alley in NE Sinisa. Stand twenty-four paces in from the street, near a crate with the letters "B2T" on it. Stay there for a short time, a few minutes, then go to the Silver Spur Tavern and have a drink.
	-The forger, who goes by Fenny (Feyncele), sits with them and explains the terms. DC 12 Nature to see she is a Spring Eladrin, a person from the Feywild. She will forge documents at a cost of 5 gold per document. 4 for her services and materials and 1 for her information gathering team. She will be forging copies of license statements from other alchemists--changing it up so as not to draw suspicion from any one alchemist. She started as a freelance thief but now works full time for the Bank.

Alchemists will need to be hired--licenses can be forged and used to convince people of legit business, or the Crew can seek more lenient Alchemists. This will take some talking around.

## Scene B

A shadow approaches Muck--it tells him Yrah wants to talk. Yrah explains:

"I don't know much about my distant past. I know only what Tasha and Zagyg told me of it. You see, my life didn't go as planned...I'll start with what I've been told. I grew up learning magic from my parents, and eventually I joined my own group of adventurers headed by Mordenkainen. We called ourselves the Citadel of Eight. At some time, I left the circle and sought to enter the Abyss. What for, I cannot say. I have no memory of it. My memory begins with the face of my captor--then and still. Ahmon-Ibor the Sibilant Beast. The Deep Father. The Demogorgon. He...he can control me. Not all the time, only when he sees me. He used me as a tool, but I had enough freedom to continue learning the magic of the Prime Material. I learned things no other mortal knows. I used my power to understand the Planescape and its history. To understand and watch the Prime Material grow. I watched the City and its people grow and change while I remained trapped in Abysm. I became powerful enough to escape Demogorgon and come here, but Zagyg and Tasha saw my return as a threat. They saw the Demogorgon's control over me as a threat. It was enough. They imprisoned me here two hundred years ago."

He wants Muck to go talk to Mordenkainen and try to learn what happened from him. Yrah never had a chance before Zagyg imprisoned him.

Mordenkainen is in the Obsidian Citadel--a distributed Citadel with Black Towers connected by teleportation portals. There is one outside New Tanore, Ithalas, and Dragon's Rook.
Mordenkainen knew of the "plot" between Fraz Urb'luu to open an Abyssal Portal--215 years ago--but didn't believe the evidence that Yrah had. He didn't do anything. He believed, then as now, that magic of their power should not interfere with the ways of the world. After Yrah, Serten, and Muck left to go fight Fraz, Mordenkainen forbade the others from interfering. They all believe Yrah and Muck to be dead--to have Muck show up suddenly like this, with no memory of previous events smells distinctly like shapeshifting.
When Muck returns to the Obsidian Citadel, Mordenkainen immediatly expects him to be a demon in disguise--he doesn't know how Fraz actually works, dominating people, etc. Mordenkainen sicks some apprentices on the suspected demon. 1) Tier 2 wizard, 3) Tier 1 wizard.

Obsidian Citadel encounter:
The PCs have to escape! Practically endless sorcerers will attack them and call for backup until they figure out how to escape. The place they are brought to meet with Mordenkainen is a large library-themed meeting chamber on the 6th floor of the Tower. Book shelves lines the walls and a few dot the center. A large open space is at the front. All doors lock (as Arcane Lock) at the start of the encounter--the only way out is through the windows! The windows lead to outside balconies connected to thin ramps that swirl around the Citadel--Elgar will have a tough time getting down the ramps, but he can manage if he moves slowly. There are 2 balconies on the 6th floor, each has ramps winding the opposite direction. 3 total balconies need to be crossed in order to get down to the ground and escape.

XP: start, 7900. New: 9900. 14,000 to lvl 6.
2000 XP per player
+balls to SR in the Obsidian Tower, 250 XP per
+smarts to use Madam Touille, 250 XP per

New: 10,400 XP

Talking to Mordenkainen:
**You said that Yrah was locked away in a basement? What do you mean?**
If they recount what Yrah told them... "a prisoner of Demogorgon, then came back and was imprisoned for 200 years because could be a threat"
-> Mordenkainen is aghast. His friend--alive? Trapped for 2 centuries? A prisoner of Demogorgon? Demogorgon is an extremely powerful demon lord--perhaps one of the most fearsome. He is bestial, intelligent. He rules an Abyssal Realm called the Gaping Maw, centered upon a great palace--Abysm. He manufactures vile beasts, but is not known for keeping prisoners "un-modified". He's an experimentalist and an artificer of flesh. Yrah and Muck should both be studied in more depth.
	How is Yrah trapped?
		A magic circle, force cage, and forbiddance.
		-Disintigrate will destroy the force cage; a powerful Dispel Magic will rid of the magic circle.
		Zagyg is volatile--how best to approach this?

1. **Emotional Turmoil**: Mordenkainen would likely experience a whirlwind of emotions â€“ relief, joy at the possibility of his friends being alive, but also confusion, anger, and sorrow over the events that transpired over the past two centuries.
    
2. **Verification and Trust Issues**: Mordenkainen, being a seasoned wizard, would likely approach the situation with skepticism. He might employ magical means to verify the truthfulness of Muck and Yrah's claims. Spells like **Zone of Truth** or **mind-reading** might be employed to ensure that they are not deceiving him.
    
3. **Consultation with Allies**: Mordenkainen might reach out to other trusted allies or knowledgeable beings for advice. He could consult with other members of the Circle of Eight or seek the counsel of powerful entities who have knowledge of the Abyss and the Feywild.
    
4. **Investigation into Tasha and Zagig's Motivations**: Mordenkainen would likely want to understand why Tasha and Zagig imprisoned Yrah. This might involve delving into the couple's motivations, past actions, and any potential shifts in their alignments or behaviors over the years.
    
5. **Rescue Mission Planning**: If Mordenkainen is convinced of his friends' plight, he might start planning a rescue mission. This would involve gathering information about the layout and defenses of Tasha's demiplane, as well as the current capabilities of Tasha and Zagig.
    
6. **Diplomacy**: Depending on what Mordenkainen learns about Tasha's current state, he might consider diplomatic means. If Tasha has genuinely changed, Mordenkainen could attempt to negotiate Yrah's release or seek a peaceful resolution.
    
7. **Confrontation**: If diplomacy fails or if Tasha and Zagig are still a threat, Mordenkainen might prepare for a confrontation. This could involve gathering allies, acquiring powerful magical artifacts, and studying the weaknesses of his adversaries.

CONCLUSIONS: I will consult with the rest of the Circle of Eight. Needless to say, we should work to understand in more depth why Zagyg and Tasha imprisoned Yrah. What drove them to imprison their own son? What were their true motivations? If they acted out of crazed malice: Yrah should be broken free, either diplomatically through Tasha or by force.

**What do you know about the Abyss?**
First off--the only people that really know what's going on in the Abyss are Tasha and Zagyg--more Tasha.
>[!note] Orcus and Koshi
>Koshi did research in his church libraries about Orcus. This gives ADV on checks related to cult worship and historical exorcism related to Orcus. What is the "historiography" of the Demon Lords at this time in the Last and First City?
>Tasha and Zagyg are the first methodical demonologists. Prior to the writing of the demonomicon, nothing was really known about the Demon Lords, the organization of the Abyss, etc. What WAS known came from two main sources: 1. the writings of exorcists and cultists across the Planescape, 2. accounts of demonic injunction from different planes. The second is much more rare to find on the Prime Material; only interplanar scholars or merchants would bring such material.
>What Koshi knows comes primarily in the context of interviewed cultists and exorcists. Demons that develop cult worship generally have the goal of being summoned, causing mayhem, and generating an injunction that they can develop for later torment. However, different demons have different flavors in which they do this. Orcus's demons and Orcus himself tend to grow cults focused around necromancy, undeath, and reveling in the loss and decay of living flesh. Further, cult ecstatics often exclaim about a great power that Orcus possesses, a power of ultimate unraveling and destruction that can slay the gods. If the cults grow quite powerful, they can even manage to do a "partial summoning" while in a trance like state. The partial summoning essentially only summons the Realm of the demon they target, rather than summoning the demon itself. In this state they can usually commune with the demon or reach some sort of ecstasy related to reaching its realm. This sort of communion usually ends in a permanent (until exorcised) mental injunction that the demon can use to further torment and possess the worshiper until death. Some injunctions are large enough that a Demon can target the minds of those around the worshiper, such as family or friends.
>Cult worship of Orcus seems to have been around for centuries. It spiked about 200 or so years ago--its hard to get exact dates--and continued to rise until about 150 years ago, when it dropped off to almost non-existent. Since then, it's been slowly on the rise again. The few cult writings that come from after this period have a distinctly different flavor to them: they do not often name "Orcus", but rather a distinctly similar being called "Tenebrous", or the "Shadow that Was". This Tenebrous tends to have similar cult worship usually associated with Orcus, but is depicted as more of a shadowy fiend rather than the classically demonic Orcus. The worship of Tenebrous/Orcus after this time hint at some new goal of "rejuvenation", "revivification", and "reformation".

Mordenkainen only understands what Tasha has told him:
The Abyss is dominated by three great realms: the Three Pillars, but there are many realms besides these. Possibly an infinite number. There is one Astral Bridge to the Abyss: the Blood Rift between the Second Pillar and the first of the hells, Avernus. This is the site of the Blood War that rages between Devils and Demons.

Demons live within the Abyss--though I don't really know what it means for a demon to "live". Tasha believes they are beings of almost singular mindset--they have no capability for empathy, and they don't even see other "demons" as being living beings. It seems to me that there is little ambition within the Deepness Gloam--the Abyss--and that each Demon wants only to cause as much destruction as it can in the present. "Scheming" and "Demon" do not mix--diabolical plans are the realm of the Devils of the Hells. Demons are chaos incarnate; plans do not beseech them. Each demon believes itself to be the center of the Planescape and the master of its torment. Demons rise from the pit of the Abyss and exist only to rend tear and destroy.

Internally, the most powerful Demons--the Demon Lords--are constantly vying for power against each other.

Tasha has told me that there are 11 notable Demon Lords, some much more powerful than others:
*Unknown:*
Malcanthet
*Demon Lords that CANNOT teleport:*
Yeenoghu
Jubilex
Baphomet
Pazuzu
*Demon Lords that CAN teleport:*
Demogorgon
Var-Az (Fraz)
Grazzt
Lolth
Orcus
Zuggtmoy

The greatest among these demons are Orcus, Demogorgon, Grazzt, Var-Az, and Lolth.

**What do you know about Muck and Yrah?**
1. 215 years ago, the cult of Orcus was on the rise. Orcus is known as the Blood Lord, the Master of Death, the Lord of the Undead. He has built a great force of demons and supports them with his mastery of undoing death. Nobody really knew anything about the Abyss at this point--all we knew is that it was obscure, mysterious, and malevolent.
    215 Years Ago, Yrah and Muck stole an artifact called the Tome of Zyx from Zagyg. In its pages they discovered a plot by Orcus to open a new Blood Rift within our Empire. Yrah and Muck and Serten ventured into the Abyss, against Mordenkainen's wishes. Then as now, he is a staunchly neutral man. Yrah, Muck, and Serten never returned, and Orcus's cult only grew stronger. Mordenkainen assumed that Yrah and Muck failed and were killed by Orcus. The fact that Muck is here now points to Abyssal interference.
	Mordenkainen can cast a spell that tests if Muck is a demon, does so, and learns that he is not a demon. Not shapeshifted. In that case, the question becomes...why is Muck still alive?
	Lost memories are a stable of demonic shapeshifting or possession (demons will erase old memories to make you a better tool).
	Upon inspection, Mordenkainen can learn that Muck has no heart. No heart--but still alive. Not undead. He also learns that there is a powerful mind warding spell on him! Such spells are used to prevent telepathic links and commands.

**What happened after Yrah and Muck disappeared?**
After Yrah was lost to the Abyss, Tasha spiraled into a crazed state and Zagyg began to go mad. Before this he was sane; fully became the "Mad Wizard" about 50 years ago or so. (the Hollow Heart injunction caused this madness) Tasha made it her life's goal to study the Abyss and its denizens, and she became the world's foremost Abyssal Scholar. She created a book, the Demonomicon, from the foundation of the Tome of Zyx that encodes everything she's learned. She left the city soon after penning the Demonomicon, but eventually she came back. She disappeared again for a few decades before coming back and founding Prismeer. She seemed...different this time. We meet occasionally, though not often. Especially not in the last months since the Prophecy was revealed.

**What do you know about the Prophecy?**
*In the grasp of the Deepness Gloam, the Candle King a Black Blade mourns,*
*Blade Black as the Unhallowed Tome, Six by six by six its pages shorn, fate unwound to the hollowed bone.*
The Deepness Gloam is another name for the Abyss. *In the grasp of the Deepness Gloam...a Black Blade mourns* obviously means that a demon will attempt to use some black sword to kill the Emperor. The *Unhallowed Tome*...the Demonomicon. The vile book can only be described as Unhallowed. I'm not sure about the next line...*six by six by six its pages shorn, fate unwound to the hollowed bone*.

**What do you plan to do about this?**
Nothing.

--
Over 215 years ago, demon cults were on the rise. After the Planerace and the rise of gate magic, demonic communion grew and cult powers rose--cults to devils, arch fey, demons, etc. The rate of cult magic in the Shadaean Empire grew from ~40th century onward, when the LFC was being connected. The rate kicked up once more after Touchstone was created in the 51st century. So, the history of demonic cults is about 2000 years old.
	So...over 215 years ago, demon cults were a problem for the better part of 1500 years, but they weren't overwhelming. Fraz himself didn't have any overt cults--he was always under the guise of another demon lord. Nothing was known about the Abyss, but its influence was becoming undeniable.
215 Years Ago, Yrah and Muck stole the Tome of Zyx, from Zagyg and discovered a plot by Orcus to open a new Blood Rift on the Prime Material. Yrah and Muck and Serten ventured into the Abyss, never to return, against the wishes of Mordenkainen. Orcus' cult grew stronger after this, so Mordenkainen is forced to believe that Yrah and Muck failed and were killed by Orcus. After her son was lost to the Abyss, Tasha spiraled into a crazed state. She learned much about the Abyss, becoming the world's foremost Abyssal Scholar. She created a book, the Demonomicon, from the foundation of the Tome of Zyx that encodes everything she's learned. With it, controlling and defeating demons is much easier.

There are three great Demon Princes: Demogorgon, Grazzt, and Orcus. Orcus seems to be the most powerful of them, possessing a magic that can destroy anything with simply an utterance. Demogorgon and Grazzt are rivals, vieing for power.
The prophecy that was revealed in the Tome of Zyx stated that Orcus is trying to invade, and the new prophecy makes Mordenkainen believe that Orcus is going to be the one that tries to destroy the Demonomicon and kill the Emperor with a Black Blade.

How to make this even more difficult? - Do Scene B, then immediately inform them of Scene A about to happen. They need to get over to the warehouse
