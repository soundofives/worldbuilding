The Crew generally moves through the Mausoleum as a group, exploring from hex-to-hex in search of the Key Stones.

The exploration day is broken into three chunks: two Active, one Rest. These can be taken in any order.
Each Active chunk gives the party 3 actions to use, which they can choose from
1. Move
2. Rest
3. Activity
*Meta*: 6 members, 12-18 hours of non-rest time. Each action represents about 2-3 hours.
During each Chunk, I roll the Encounter dice to see if they trigger an encounter (1d8, Encounter on a 1). So, you get 3 rolls per day. ~40% chance of getting an encounter each day.

#### Encounter Table
>[!abstract]
>
>1 - Monster!
>2 - Puzzle
3 - Non-violent encounter
4 - Natural hazard
5 - Hidden treasure! https://5e.tools/lootgen.html, treasure hoard for levels 0-4.
6 - Roll twice. Double Monster means the area is **infested**. Double Treasure gives a hoard for levels 5-10.

##### Infestations
If a double monster is rolled, the area becomes infested with foes. There is an immediate, hostile encounter AND all subsequent triggered encounters here are monsters.

---

# Actions
### Moving
Each hex represents many miles of corridors, catacombs, and chambers.
They can choose to move **quickly**, **normally**, or **carefully**. Extra movement left after leaving a hex is lost (say you use **move carefully** twice, but an infestation gets triggered so you **move normally** to get out, you simply immediately enter an adjacent area with no progress through it.)

When moving to **quickly**,
- Move through or out of the hex with a single action.
- Cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection.
- Roll for **Quick Travel**: make a **Survival (Navigation)** check. If you fail, roll on the **Quick Travel Event** table

When moving **normally**,
- Move 1/2 of an area
- Cannot make Stealth checks to avoid detection.

When moving **carefully**,
- Move 1/3 of an area
- Gains advantage on navigation checks (if lost).
- Can make Stealth checks to avoid detection (a violent encounter must make a perception check to spot the Crew)
- The chance for a violent encounter is decreased. (If a violent encounter is generated, there is a 25% chance it doesn’t actually happen.)

The Crew should spend about 1/2 day per hex. Ideally they'll trigger 8 encounters. With a 50% encounter chance each day (and a 40% chance of two encounters a day), I'll want about 16 days, or ~32 hex traversals.
##### Quick Travel Event
>[!abstract]
>1. The floor crumbles under you into a small pit, DEX 15 or take 2d10 fall damage.
>2. You find a moss covered corridor (Nature 18, otherwise everyone makes a **DC 12** Dex Save), its corrosive and will permanently decrease your armor's AC bonus by 1.
>3. You open a chamber and volcanic gas rushes out, filling the whole area and (**DC 15 DEX**) choking/surprising you. A quick Skill Challenge to navigate your way out of the gas cloud (3 successes, 3 failures, **DC 14 CON** but your mind is addled by the mercuric fumes, giving disadvantage on all checks.)
>4. Trap! Slicing blades! DC 15 to detect, DC 15 to avoid, 4d10 on fail.
>5. Trap! Protected Glyph, targeting all intruders in a large area who fail a **DC 15** Religion check and recite a Tanorian Chant of passage. On fail, all take 4d10 necrotic damage. Also gives Disadvantage on the next wandering monster roll.
>6. Trap! DC 14 DEX. You clumbsily touch a decaying corpse next to a well, and it fall in--metal armor and all. Nothing happens right now, but roll with disadvantage on your next Wandering Monster roll.


### Activity
- **Forage for food or supplies** (if you're low, forage with a **Survival (forage)** check. On success, find enough food for 1 day. If you succeed by 5 or more, you find enough food for 2 days for the whole Crew. If you take a Long Rest without food, you take 1 level of exhaustion.)
- **Sentinel** (while moving, make a perception check to detect encounters.)
- **Investigate the area** (roll an **Investigation, Survival, or Insight** check (**DC 18**) to locate the keyed location within the region, or identify the hex as empty. On a successful check, I roll 1d6. On a 1 or 2, they find the keyed location, otherwise they correctly identify the area as empty. If they are on the last possible tile for a location, a successful investigation will always reveal the keyed location. If you identify the hex as empty, roll on the Encounter Table, but only act on rolls of 1, 5, or 6. Treat it as if you have taken the Sentinel action to detect encounters ahead of time.)
- **Fortify** (get a more favorable position if you have a violent encounter)
- **Craft** (one potion, one scroll)
- **Other** simple downtime activity (prayer, etc)

### Rest
- One to get a Short Rest.

>[!abstract] **Puzzles**
>1. **The Dark Staircase (anywhere)** There is a staircase with an inscription above the archway leading to it. It leads down to pitch-blackness.
The inscription I like to use is _"Life leads us down dark roads, but sometimes it is necessary to see the light."_ But you can use something else thematic. Alternatively, you can hide this in faint inscriptions down the side of the stairs.
Basically, the stairs are endless until they put out all sources of light. Characters with darkvision must close their eyes. The endless monotiny of descending stairs takes its toll after a while, and eventually the PCs will have to start making concentration checks to avoid tumbling down the steps and taking superficial bludgeoning damage. Past a few hours, they might start suffering from temporary levels of exhaustion.
If they turn around, the staircase is endless that way, too.
>
>2. **Illusionary Prisoner (Sacrificial Prison)** the ancient chamber you are in suddenly comes alive with ghostly reflections of the past. Prisoners swish past, pining for their freedom and calling out from the bars. The illusion is somehow more real--the bars that appear in front of you are tactile! Many of the prisoners seems mindless, distraught, or mad, but some prisoners can give a clue on how to escape:
>   One prisoner is fashioning a digging scoop from a hunk of obsidian
>   One prisoner seems to be keeping an eye out for guards
>   One prisoner is seemingly aimlessly tapping on a floor tile
>   Other prisoners distract from these:
>   One prisoner is clawing at the walls
>   One prisoner is praying
>   Two prisoners are fighting
>
>3. **Cursed Passage Stones** - A room has stones of different colors, enough for each character to have one, and the far door is blocked by an invisible barrier. When a character picks up a stone, he is imbued with a curse chosen by the DM which must include a condition that they cannot talk about their own curse. When the group verbally identifies a character's curse in a general sense, that character can pass through the barrier. Once through, the curse is lifted. A clue on the wall appears only when all characters are cursed: "When your affliction is identified, only then may you pass.
>
>The curses I chose for my players: None of them could talk or act out of character, none could talk about their own curse, and they each got one of the following:
>- You cannot speak unless someone else is speaking. You are then compelled to talk loudly over them.
>- You cringe sharply in pain or fear whenever you speak or hear a word containing the letter F.
>- You cannot use any nouns except pronouns ("it, that, he, she"). You can also say, "thing".
>- You can only gesture / pantomime, you cannot verbally speak--but you can write.
>- Every time you start speaking, you MUST voice your opinion. ie, "In my opinion, that is a bad idea." or "I like that! ..."
>-You can ONLY speak when the person sitting to your left is silent.
>  
>  4. **The Empty Gauntlet (Sacrificial Chamber area)** There is a shallow water well with stone walls in a small round room, only one way in, the room is about 10-15 feet across. At the far side of the well, a stone statue stands with one arm raised in a fist, index finger pointing to the ground. The other hand holds a tablet with runes translating to: _'Be humbled, trespasser... you believe your destination is beneath you but you mustn't miss the point.'_ In the water, about 2 feet down, a metal gauntlet hovers magically, glowing blue in the clear water, fingers outstretched toward the statue. The gauntlet is immovable unless worn. The water level rests 1.5 feet above the gauntlet.
>     
>     _Action:_ The door mechanism is activated by placing a hand in the gauntlet. Once a hand is placed into the gauntlet, and any motion is made with the hand or fingers, it rotates freely in 360 degrees, but clasps the wrist of the wearer, unable to remove their hand. The floor of the well starts mechanically dropping and filling with water, pulling the gauntlet and the wearer with it. The wearer must solve the door puzzle before drowning.
>     
>     _Solution:_ The wearer must mimic the hand gesture of the statue, pointing down. The clue is in the runes. The hand gesture activates the door, which stops the flow of water, reverses bottom of the well, releases the hand of the wearer, and then starts to drop the floor of the entire room, well included, into another room below. The entire room acts as the point of entry. (edit for clarity)
>     
> 5. The Way In
>    A blocked door with pressable square stones inscribed with letters. A riddle on the door states: "The Scribe's Door. From the depths to the heights we must be pressed, rune by rune in an unbroken chain. Tell me: What is the Way of Sashas? : W A Y O F B L O O D 
>| Q | **D** | M | E | K |
| X | V | **O** | P | S |
| U | **O** | **L** | H | O |
| **F** | **B** | R | T | I |
| P | **O** | **Y** | T | I |
| Z | **A** | **W** | L | C |    
>    
>    
>  6. **Children's Riddle** The room you enter seems almost like a children's lecture room. The door locks closed behind you.  PCs are confronted with a magical piece of chalk and a board that looks like this
. ll . . . . .
. . . . . . . ll . . .
The instruction written above the board is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Solution:
PC must find the correct order and numbering of the numbers which is:
2 6 6 6 66
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 4
There's one 2, three 4's, five 6's and seven 8's

>[!abstract] **Non violent encounters**
>1.  Shiraj the Questing Revenant. **Automatically found in the Catacombs**. Hints about vampire's abilities (hit dice drain).
>2. or 4. Ghostly illusions of Suryastra herself--pushed out of her own being by Bash, who has possessed her. She talks about her conquests and the fateful encounter and folly of finding the blade. She engages in discussions about power, destiny, rule, and dark magic.
>3. Ghosts of Suryastra's advisors, each killed by her with the Blade. One was smart, the other strong (gladiator), the third was a famous poet. Ever the good sports, challenge the Crew to a game--Liar's Dice, where each participant has two dice. The newly dumb ghost doesn't play, but the other two do--and they cheat by getting to now each others' dice. If they succeed, they will be gifted a boon (**Boon of Sashas - a small jade holy symbol. Usable once, acts as a revivification spell**) If they fail...disadvantage on wandering monster roll!
>4. or 2. (second time). Library of poems and a ghostly romantic, Suryastra. This is for her second meeting. If the PCs meet her twice, she provides a clue about how to deal with her body, possessed by the Black Blade -- she can't help but listen to poetry!
>5. A neutral umber hulk burrows up from the ground, providing a short cut to a random location.
>6. An apprentice to the forgemaster (vampire, CR 13, can be killed but will induce a disadvantage on Wandering Monster check), an enchanted vampire who never needs blood, who warns about the mage, rolling around the Mausoleum with a cart of supplies he'll gladly sell. He's gone mad, and he is playing make-believe about being back in the city of Tanore. He usually sells bones to the starvelings. His payment: Tanorian gold (all gold acquired through Hidden Treasure. Each empty tile has 1/3 chance of giving 100-200 gold. There are 18 empty tiles, so about 6 will give gold. This averages to about 600-1200 Tanorian gold pieces, with  about 500 in some keyed location. So they'll get about 2600-3100 gp). He sells:
>	1. Key to Uzaxuk's shackles, 100 gp
>	2. greater healing potions for 100 gp
>	3. scroll of protection (5ft barrier) for 100 gp
>	4. Potion of resistance for 200 gp
>	5. Elixirs of health for 100 gp
>	6. Elixirs of Vital Blood (1 lost hit die) for 100 gp
>	7. Ghost Lantern, 1200 gp
>	8. Gloves of Missile snaring, 800 gp
>	9. Cloak of protection, 900 gp
>	10. circlet of blasting, 700 gp
>	11. Acheron spear, 800 gp
>	    
>	If the Crew keeps the Tanorian gold, each gold is worth 2 gp in the outside world.
>

>[!abstract] **Natural Hazards**
>	1. Earthquake! Rocks fall from the ceiling! DC 12 or 3d10 damage. This Area is **blocked.**
>	2.  Magma rift opens! DC 14 or take 4d10 damage (half on success!). This area is **blocked** unless they want to try crossing in a skill challenge.
>	3. Fissure opens and floor crumbles! DC 15 or get sent down to catacombs (first time), or find yourself stuck in the rock. DC 20 STR, but any roll succeeds--but the defecit is the number of hours you are stuck! Cumulative among all those who are stuck.
>	4. - 6. Roll on the **Quick Travel Table**.
