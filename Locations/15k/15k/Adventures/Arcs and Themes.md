One large arc is the story of Zagyg, Tasha, Fraz, Kas, Vecna, the Lineaments, and the Abyss.

Summary:
The Emperor, Vecna, is planning to open a Gate to the Abyss. In order to do this most effectively, he wanted the Prince of Demons--Fraz--gone from the picture, but he wanted the Hollow Staff to give some semblance of control over the demons. While he helped Zagyg and Tasha capture Fraz, he believes the Hollow Staff to have been destroyed along with the Ichor Lance--or at least that the Staff was scattered throughout the Planescape in the ensuing chaos in Hollow's Heart. He has been allocating significant resources to planar expeditions over the last several hundred years, hunting for rumors of the Staff.
In reality, Tasha used the Staff to create the Demonomicon--it is still hidden inside the grimoire. Nobody truly knows what Vecna is doing, or that he's deliberately searching for the Staff.
Once the Prophecy is revealed, things start to kick into gear. The most powerful parties in the game are alerted to each other. Additionally, Zagyg is able to use Fraz' Demonic Amulet to force him to reveal, partially, Vecna's plan. Zagyg only learns of this AFTER the prophecy is revealed. After this time, he tells Tasha and Mordenkainen of the plot--but they don't work together. Tasha continues to hide in Prismeer, Mordenkainen seeks the aid of an Avatar of Eres.
Meanwhile, several Demon Lords are working to advance their position (and Vecna's) by trying to find, control, or destroy Tasha's Demonomicon, one of the most dangerous weapons the heroes possess.
The MacGuffin: the Demonomicon, which holds the Hollow Staff.

Zagyg was a part of one of the earliest wizarding groups in the Last and First City after the rise of magical education and the construction of Touchstone. He and his Company of Seven explored the Planescape--in fact, they were some of the earliest to do so. In their travels, they came face-to-face with the horrors of the Abyss and its inevitable march towards the Prime Material. Zagyg had taken Tasha as his apprentice--and later his lover--and they plotted a way to understand the Abyss like non before. After all, knowledge is power. They made a deal with Demogorgon and Grazzt to willingly summon their mutual enemy, Fraz Urb'luu, to the Prime Material and imprison him. Demogorgon and Grazzt removed Fraz as a key enemy and power-player in the Abyss. Zagyg and Tasha gained a valuable prisoner that they could interrogate and learn everything there was to know about the Abyss.

Fraz Urb'luu is more than just a demonlord. He was one of the oldest lords of the Abyss, ruler of Hollow's Heart, Reagent of the Second Column, and Third Prince of Demons. Fraz is the Prince of Deception, Lord of Lies--he is a being of supreme intelligence, ambition, and abilities. He is an veritable archmage among the trolls of the other demon lords. His staff, created with the essentia of Mycelia, grants supreme power over Hallow's Heart and the Second Column of the Abyss. It is an artifact of unmatched power. Possibly the only two mages capable of outmatching Fraz are Zagyg and Tasha, considered by their peers to be the most powerful wizards in the Planescape.

When Tasha and Zagyg summoned Fraz to the Prime Material, they used and destroyed a powerful magical artifact--the Ichor Lance--to weaken him enough to trap him. Together they interrogated him and created their magnum opus: the Demonomicon. At the heart of the Demonomicon is the Staff of Fraz Urb'luu, which gives the book many of its powerful attributes.

With the capture of Fraz, the demon hordes were handed off to Demogorgon, Grazzt, and the other Lords. After Zagyg and Tasha finished the Demonomicon, she fell to its corrupting power and fled to Grazzt's embrace, leaving Zagyg with Fraz. For hundreds of years she committed atrocities as the Witch Queen of Perrenland, Natasha the Dark, Iggwilv, Hura of Ket, and other names.

Vecna is Grace, Lineament corrupted by Artifex and turned mortal. Using his knowledge, he founded the Shadaean Empire and the Last and First City, building the Imperial Cult and turning himself into an Apotheid--a god. With the magical power of an Apotheid, Vecna sought to open a great Abyssal injunction and bring down Asfalon.

Through his interrogations of Fraz, Zagyg uncovers this plot and forms an alliance of the most powerful mortals and Auhrons of the Planescape. While this alliance is being formed, a group of mercenaries meets Fraz, who involves them in this tale as he tries to manipulate his way to freedom, sabotage Zagyg, and lead the armies of the Abyss to overrun the Prime Material.

The party first experiences this arc through the manipulations of Fraz, posing as Zagyg's lost son Yrag.

The canon ending:
Eventually, the vampire Kas teams up with the Circle of Eight, Tasha, and Zagyg to kill Vecna--but they fail. Kas is destroyed after he uses the Thief Blade recovered by Zagyg to sever the hand and eye of Vecna. Halmadar, servant of Vecna, kills the archmages of the Circle of Eight, save Mordenkainen, who exiles Vecna and Touchstone to the plane of Ravenloft before escaping himself into the Planescape.

Thoughts on other important figures:
Guire, Eres, and Bash
Guire works to preserve life and fight for Asfalon, so he wants to help Zagyg and the others. He is the Aspect God Haere. He, as the enigmatic patron of the land, protects the PCs in disasters and on journeys.
Eres wants to return and become the most powerful person, master of all realms and the arcane. An old manifestation of her, Sashas, is returning in a Renaissance of magical learning. Despite this, she also created the Aurhal Autochthon of Cathorin. Eres does not want the Prime Material to be overrun by demons, so she works against Vecna. She is of like mind to Mordenkainen, and she had him create an Avatar for her to act as his consort.
