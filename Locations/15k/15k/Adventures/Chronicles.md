Rabbitouille was killed by the Shynedar-Kai assassins, and the Crew threw their budding alchemical business into overdrive to build their fortune to revive him. By putting all their contacts to work, hiring a new master apothecary, and renting a new warehouse work space, enough gold was profitted for Saamy Simic to scribe a scroll of the powerful spell _Lyzandred's Soul Delve_ after over 5 months of work. The Crew worked with the Wizardead Soroush of the Tower to delve into Rabbitouille's soul and temporarily free him from the Curse--buying themselves just enough time to revive him.

The Crew visits the Touille Estate, where they find out that RabbiTouille's parents have gotten involved with the Church of the Cycladenes--the Shynedar worshippers. Nevertheless, they use Madam Touille to get an audience with Mordenkainen. The audience goes south when Mordenkainen accuses Muck of being a shape-shifted demon and orders his apprentices to kill the Crew.

11. **Session 11**: What Comes Next? Mordenkainen tells the Crew that Yrah, Muck, and another member of the Circle of Eight named Serten travelled to the Abyss 215 years ago to stop a plot by Orcus to invade the Prime Material plane. Upon learning that Yrah was trapped in the Tower's dungeons, Mordenkainen suggested a few options: free Yrah, learn more about the demons that might be involved by finding the Demonomicon, or tracking down Serten. The Demonomicon, written and held by Yrah's mother Tasha, is the decisive grimoire for abyssal knowledge of demonkind. It could answer all the Crew's questions and help stop any demonic presence, but Tasha and the Demonomicon have vanished entirely--along with the entire Feywild demiplane of Prismeer. While the Crew left Mordenkainen's with more questions than answers, they were picked up by Borlaw Duskivaine, a representative of the Bank of Miros. He warned them of an impending attack by a Cycladene tough squad on their warehouse. The Crew arrived in time to deal with the squad, but the warehouse was destroyed. Afterward, Borlaw told the Crew that their deal with the Bank was done. At least publicaly. The Bank would help support the Crew in increasing their business two-fold, but they have to do it in secret.
