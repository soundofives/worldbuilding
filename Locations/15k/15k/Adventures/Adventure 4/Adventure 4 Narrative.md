During / after downtime, Drakewolf says he's gotten permission from Taforayesh to "borrow" the party for a private job in "cleaning up the crypts".  You'll get a bonus of 3 gold pieces--but more than that, Drakewolf tells you this:

>[!quote] Drakewolf
>**"We're going to get through that door. And I'd give my ass to the Gods if Zagyg isn't hiding something worth an insane amount of money behind it. You'll each get a cut--even split."**


The Door is blocked by a Forbiddance spell cast by Vezel Mossvale, the Wizardead of Wards in the Tower.

Forbiddance (no teleportation), password set by Vezel is " Providence "

### Guards and Wards

The door opens into a small labyrinth filled with thick fog. Entering, you have to pass through a winding, narrow corridor that comes to a triple branch--at this point, it turns out the fog itself is **vampiric mist**, which is sentient and trying to kill you! You have to get out. Going to any of the branches--even going back-- leads you to a puzzle room.

All 4 of the rooms lead to the Puzzle Room.

#### Boblin's Dice
The mist opens up into a small room with a single wooden table at the center. Sitting at the Table is what looks to be a statue of Zagyg.

>[!quote] Statue of Zagyg
>"A key to pass by me you'll need, the find this freeing key, a game of Boblin's dice it'll be. Fail, and give to me one of three: the color from your eyes, the warmth of your blood, or the key to your body."
>
>- color from eyes: go completely colorblind
>- warmth from your heart: you lose the ability to be warm, your skin always feels cold
>- key to your mind: a literal key appears at the far end of the room -- you feel compelled towards it. When this key is farther than 10 feet from you, your strength drops to 3. (Needs help to stand, can be knocked over by strong breezes)
>  
>The game of Boblin's Dice entails a "best two out of three" contested d20 roll
>
>Even if you lose, you the mouth of the statue opens and pops out a key for the door behind you.

#### Wind Tunnel

Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. **DC 15**. Getting blown off lands you in 

A narrow bridge, perpendicular across the center is a blowing tunnel of wind threatening to throw you down below into spider's webs (the Spider Stairs)

**Webs**
The target is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by webbing. As an action, the [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

Getting past the wind tunnel sends you to a staircase that goes down to the Puzzle Room.

#### Suggestion

This is a small room with a central stone statue of Zagyg. The statue speaks:

A **DC 15** Wisdom save or you are influenced by the following suggestion:

**"You're in trouble! Come talk to me! immediately!"**

#### Spider Stairs

A wide stairwell filled with spiders webs as "web spell"

***WEB***
You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are [difficult terrain](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_13) and [lightly obscure](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:The%20Environment?expansion=0#toc_3) their area.  

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  
  
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [restrained](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_12) as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  
  
A creature restrained by the webs can use its actions to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  **DC 15**
  
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

-There are 2 Giant Spiders in the webs!

The stairwell goes for 3 stories, or 30 ft of movement.

### Puzzle Room

A statue of a woman with snakey hair stands in the center of the room, her eyes locked on her own reflection in a mirror. Held in her hand is a key, also turned to stone. At the far end of the room, a thick door stands--it is magically locked. Above the door this inscription is carved:

>[!quote] Puzzle
>**"In a room of stone where gaze meets gaze, a woman in stony cage. A key of stone in one's jaws, through Sashas' eye will time un-pause."**
>
>Painting the Eye of Sashas on everyone's forehead will unfreeze the basilisks, which will drop the key and attack the players.
>**DC 15** arcana or religion will remind them of some basic lore about Sashas, 
>**DC 10** insight, intelligence, etc, will remind them that Zagyg is a worshiper of Sashas, as is Soroush. The tiled mosaic in the Atrium is of Sashas.

>[!success] XP
> (500 xp)

The Puzzle room has a large central chamber and four cave-like winding side tunnels that bend back on each other. One goes down and has difficult water terrain at the bottom, the other goes up and has a ledge that needs to be climbed (**DC 14 athletics / acrobatics to cost 0 extra movement, otherwise it takes half movement speed**)

### ***LEFT OFF HERE***

Several stalagtites hang on the ceiling in the main chamber, and they can be knocked down to provide pillars that block line of sight.
