The party is recovering from their injuries in Adventure 1. They have about 10 days in the Tower under the care of [[Cleric Samira]]. During that time, the High Wizardead [[Zagyg]] returns to the Tower.

### **Scene 1: Return of Zagyg**

> *After the clearing of the crypt and Carric's difficult moral dilemma to spare the Flesh Monster, you've been taking time to recover in the Chapel of the Myriad's hospital wing. The [[Chapel to the Myriad]] is a vibrant room with many small alcoves budding off from the room's central rotunda. The chapel is covered floor to ceiling with eclectic religious imagery. Tapestries, mosaics, simple painted canvases, it seems evident that the Myriad Faces of God prefer to be represented in countless styles, motifs, and icons. To one side of the rotunda is a doorway leading to the hospital dedicated to Om, God's Aspect of fertility, health, children, etc.*
> 
> *The hospital is attended by the [[Cleric Samira]], a fussy middle-aged new-world elf woman. She dutifully tends to Carric's face scar and the minor wounds of the others. As for Rabbitouille's eviscerated shoulder, the Wizardead Soroush meets you and readies a new corpse for you.*

>[!quote] Soroush
>*Soroush is a human in his late 30's, just beginning to grey in his well-cropped beard--he is young for someone so accomplished. His face is lined from stress and toil. He is followed by a ghostly woman dressed in robes characteristic of Old Shada, a fashion long-passed. Soroush wears blue robes lined with red and gold silks, and his forehead is tattooed with a black Third Eye. After meeting with you in the Atrium, he walks you up to the [[Necromantic Laboratory]].
>
>The lab is high in the Tower on the 22nd floor: a gruesome lab filled with skeletons of all sorts of species and tanks of magical liquid preserving vile creations. The Necromantic Laboratory serves as a place to study the mechanisms of life and death.*
>
>**"You must be the new gentleman on the Crew that everyone is talking about. I've been told to prepare a corpse for you--I have one ready upstairs. Come, follow me.**
>*A freshly preserved and balmed corpse is laid out on a wooden operating table.*
>*If Soroush is allowed to see the Ritual:*
>**"My...what a curious specimen you are. I'd love to work closer with you, and possibly spend some hours studying your...predicament."

>*The Flesh Monster is being treated in the hospital as well, though in a private chamber. After a day of initial recovery, a hullabaloo stirs in the Tower. [[Zoran Drakewolf]] gathers you up--*

>[!quote] Drakewolf
>**"Come on! The High Wizardead just arrived. Come meet him! I want to see what he's brought back from the City."

>*The Atrium ceiling is cloudy and dim when you enter. As you and a few students gather in the Atrium, the ghost [[Taforayesh]] floats over to you*

>[!quote] Taforayesh
>**"Samira has just told me that the creature you all fished from the Crypts has awoken. It seems to mostly retain the mind of Nedavir, though the other Adepts are in there as well, surfacing in fits of confusion and violence. He can't stay in the upper floors of the Tower, so I have decided that he will serve as the new Crypt Warden. He'll clean the place up and prepare it for regular use again."**

>*Suddenly, the ogre doorman [[Gizigrut]] grunts and begins to pull the grand Atrium doors open. Before he can open them more than a crack, he is pushed back as the doors fly open, propelled by the force of a leaping young dragon. Scurrying behind the stampeding beast is a small hunched man in red robes trimmed with gold. He seems to be a High Elf with skin of gold white scraggly hair and beard. His eyes are covered by a red sash and a black Third Eye is tattooed on his forehead. Floating around his head in lazy circles is what appears to be a glowing disembodied eyeball. The hem of the wizard's robe is smoking and charred from what seems to be an altercation with the dragon, though the damage doesn't extend to the pair of long, mis-matched woolen socks on the High Wizardead's feet.*

>[!quote] Zagyg
>**"Ah! Somebody, stop that dragon!"**
>
>>[!warning] Stopping the Dragon
>>**Contested STR Check (+4)** or **Animal Handling DC 12**

>*Zagyg snaps at the ceiling, and the clouds part to reveal a calm sunrise. He babbles incoherent welcomes to all and instructs the dragon to stay in the Library. [[Sora]] the libraries balks at this and hurries after it as it galomps its way up the stairs.*

### **Scene 2: Downtime**

>*You have ten more days of recovery period. What do you do?*

1. The Crew is introduced to some other students: Daliborn and Dragana Regalwood, elf siblings. [[Saamy Nightscribe]] if they use the [[Library]]. [[Dariush the Quiet]] if they explore the [[Gardens]]. Professors if they explore the Tower more.
2. [[Zoran Drakewolf]] mentions that he wants to explore the Crypt, and asks if you have anything that could help. He explores the cleared Crypt and finds the chamber of [[Fraz]], warded strongly. He wants to show the PCs, and says they should keep a lookout for any magic that can break powerful wards--and they should probably keep quiet about it.

The PCs can use their recovery time as light downtime. They can go into the city as long as they don't do much strenuous stuff.

After a short explanation of downtime, [[Taforayesh]] summons the Crew and reveals a ransom note delivered to the Tower. Apparently a group of ruffians kidnapped [[Hasur Highfallow]] while he was out buying new legal textbooks and is demanding a ransom of 300 gold. You are tasked with fetching him.

**[[Scene 3 - Rescue of Hasur Highfallow]]**

These come in nodes:

A. The Chapel of the Cycladenes
B. Tree-Knob Plaza
C. The Sewers

It turns out that a lower Aristocrat family--the Mountainglades--put the Young Devils up to this. The young son of the Mountainglades attempted to attend the Tower under Zagyg's tutelage, but he wasted his family's money, and, eventually, accrued a sizeable date to the Tower. They kidnapped Hasur to accomplish a few goals:
1. Make back some of the money their son lost
2. Intimidate Hasur to drop the debts
The actual act of randoming Hasur was entirely the Young Devil's idea.


This will lead to next week's portion of the adventure:
