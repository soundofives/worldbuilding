# Adventure 2 Overview

The party is recovering from their injuries in Adventure 1. They have about 10 days in the Tower under the care of [[Cleric Samira]]. During that time, the High Wizardead [[Zagyg]] returns to the Tower.

**Scene 1: Return of Zagyg**

Zagyg is back--and he's brought a new pet brass dragon.

**Scene 2: Downtime**
Other things happen during these ten days!
1. The Crew is introduced to some other students: Daliborn and Dragana Regalwood, elf siblings. [[Saamy Nightscribe]] if they use the [[Library]]. [[Dariush the Quiet]] if they explore the [[Gardens]]. Professors if they explore the Tower more.
2. [[Zoran Drakewolf]] explores the cleared Crypt and finds the chamber of [[Fraz]], warded strongly. He wants to show the PCs, and says they should keep a lookout for any magic that can break powerful wards--and they should probably keep quiet about it.

The PCs can use their recovery time as light downtime. They can go into the city as long as they don't do much strenuous stuff.

After a short explanation of downtime, [[Taforayesh]] summons the Crew and reveals a ransom note delivered to the Tower. Apparently a group of ruffians kidnapped [[Hasur Highfallow]] while he was out buying new legal textbooks and is demanding a ransom of 300 gold. You are tasked with fetching him--and not paying the bounty.

**[[Scene 3 - Rescue of Hasur Highfallow]]**

Hasur Highfallow is being held by a nameless group of ruffians in Touchstone who saw a defenseless nerd carrying around a lot of money. He told them his affiliation, and they sent a ransom note in order to extort and even larger sum of money from him.

**[[Scene 4 - Into the Sewers]]**

If either the confrontation in the Plaza or the Church goes poorly for the Young Devils, they try to secret Hasur away into the sewers.
