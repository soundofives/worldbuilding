It's time for Milo to take her Apprentice Exam. She's in the business of seeking power and protection: she wants a Warrior spirit. She's done research over the last few months tracking down the tomb of a powerful warrior, a human champion from the Kuhorik region during their fight against the Heavenly Sinisar Empire. The champion, **Larom**, lived around 18,215 BBT, or around the end of the 18th century of the Empire. He lived in an area near modern Bonz, and his tomb is rumored to exist in a cliffside cave just outside where the fishery district has expanded to. The tomb can only be accessed easily at low tide, which, at this time of year, will happen at night.

Scenes:
- Reaching the Tomb (climbing down the cliffside, taking a boat, etc)
- Entering / Passing the puzzle at the entrance
- Escape during the flood through shark infested waters!
- The confrontation in the entrance hall--the Shynedar Kai block the exit 

Twists: the Shynedar-Kai are back!
