#### Lifestyle Expenses

While some downtime activities allow you to circumvent this cost, if you don't plan on doing anything with your downtime (which you shouldn't), you will be required to pay this cost in order to afford lodging, food, and the maintaining of armor and weapons. The gold you pay depends on the quality of life you are living. The poorer the lifestyle, the less you pay. The cost of living might be higher or lower depending on how much gold your DM gives your party.

|Lifestyle|Price per Day|
|---|---|
|Wretched|--|
|Squalid|10 cp|
|Poor|20 cp|
|Modest|1 gp|
|Comfortable|2 gp|
|Weatlthy|4 gp|
|Aristocratic|10 gp minimum, 25-50 gp ordinary|

Alternatively, if you have proficiency in the **Survival** skill, you are able to live a comfortable life in the wild but cannot do any other activity.
Your lifestyle can gain important contacts or connections with other people. Spending time living with the poor might net you allies with the local beggars and street urchins or living an aristocratic life could help you gain favor with a wealthy noble.

#### Gaining Renown (DMG)

You can spend your downtime doing small task and socializing with members of a faction, By spending a number of **days** equal to 10 * your current renown level, you can increase your renown by 1 point.

#### Training (PHB/XGtE)

Self-improvement is important for everyone, including your character. You can learn new languages, tool proficiencies, and skills. First, you need to find a mentor or instructor to teach you how to do the new ability. They can range from a war general teaching you how to use a certain weapon, a professor teaching you a language, or a wood elf teaching you how to survive in the wilds. After you find your teacher, you can spend a number of **days** and **gold** learning the skill, and at the end of the process, you'll be proficient in the tool, language, or skill. If you want your character to speak a specific language or pick up a specific tool set for roleplaying reasons, then I would suggest training with your downtime.

-Can learn a language, tool, or skill. Takes 70 days of downtime, and 25 gp per week. The number of weeks is reduced by your intelligence modifier.
#### Practicing a Profession (PHB)

If you don't want to pay those pesky lifestyle expenses, you can go from action-packed adventuring to working a 9-5 job. Practicing a profession allows you to live a modest lifestyle without paying the cost as long as you keep working. If you are apart of a guild or group, like a thieves guild, you instead gain enough for a comfortable lifestyle. Finally, if your character is willing to put themselves out there and has a proficiency in performance, they can perform and maintain a wealthy lifestyle without paying the cost.
#### Carousing (DMG)

Carousing means living a lavish life, consisting of partying, drinking, gambling, and anything that relieves stress. A player spends enough money to maintain a wealthy lifestyle, or **4 gp per day** , and at the end of the period, they roll on a table to see what happens. The results can range from being arrested, to falling in love, to winning money while gambling. Gambling specifically:  focusing on gambling throws out all the other events and lets you deal purely with money. And if you have proficiency in any of the gaming sets, like dice or card sets, then this is your time to shine. Gambling requires a **week** and anywhere from **10 gp** to **1000 gp**. You will make a series of skill checks depending on how you want to gample (maybe pure luck, or skills such as sleight of hand, deception, or your various gaming set proficiencies). The results can range from crippling debt to winning up to three times your bet. Overall, if you're confident in lady luck or know the tricks of the trade, gambling is a fun way of earning money.
#### Making Contacts (XGtE)

You choose whether to spend time with the lower, middle, or upper class, costing **10**, **50**, and **250 gp** per **week** respectively. If you want to spend time with the upper class, you'll either need access to the local nobility or be disguised with one. During the week you mingle, party, and socialize with members of that social class. At the end of the **week**, you gain a number of contacts within that class. Some examples are criminals in the lower class, artisans in the middle class, and nobles in the upper class. This option is great for collecting allies and intel, especially if you are new to the area.

99. You wake up to find yourself seated at a table. There is a quill in one hand and a small cut on the other. Across from you sits a well-dressed but sinister man, a man of wealth and taste. In front of you is a contract detailing in extremely complex terms, the exchange of power for your immortal soul. (Once the contract is signed or if the PC refuses, the man disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke.)
100. Roll Twice, DM comes up with a monstrous combination of the two.
#### Crafting Non-Magical Items (PHB & XGtE)

If you have enough time, tools, and materials, you can finally put those tool proficiencies to use and create something. For every day of downtime, you can craft up to **5 gp** worth of items and spend half the cost in raw materials. If the item you are trying to craft exceeds **5 gp**, you can make **5 gp** of progress towards it per day, and if multiple people work on it, they each add an additional **5 gp** of progress towards it. So if you have proficiency in smith's tools, you can spend **10 days** to create a great sword (**50 gp**), or if you have a friend helping you, you can create the great sword in only **5 days**. In addition, while you are crafting, you can maintain you a modest lifestyle without paying the cost or a comfortable lifestyle for half the cost.

Doing this can be a good way of getting mileage out of your tool proficiency without waiting for an opportunity. Forge Clerics can create armor and Assassins can create poisons. If you don't want to pay the lifestyle cost and you have a tool proficiency, this is probably the best thing you can do.

#### Crafting Magical Items and Brewing Potions (DMG & XGtE)

Crafting Magic Items: Alternatively, if you're a spell caster **with tool proficiencies**, you can add a touch of magic to your items. Crafting a magical item is a long and complicated process. First the crafter needs to be able to cast spells, and if they're imbuing an item with a specific spell, they must be able to cast it. If the item requires a tool proficiency to make, like if you're making a magic sword, the crafter will need proficiency in said tools, like smith's tools. Second, the crafter will need a formula of the magical item. If the crafter is creating their own, home brewed item or I (the DM) feel like it, the formula might not be needed. Third, you will need materials. Unlike non-magical items, magical items require specific materials that could take whole adventures to gather. Check with me to see what you need and how hard it is to gather.

Once you have all the requirements, you can finally start crafting. For the PHB, you can craft up to **25gp** worth of item per day, and as with non-magical items, having a friend will help speed up the process by 25 gp. The time it takes to craft it depends on the rarity of the magical item. For Xanthar's guide, the workweek and gold cost depend on the rarity.

|Item Rarity|Cost|Minimum Level|tenday weeks (XGtE)|Cost (XGtE)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Common|100 gp|3rd|1|50 gp|
|Uncommon|1000 gp|3rd|2|200 gp|
|Rare|5,000 gp|6th|10|2,000 gp|
|Very Rare|50,000 gp|11th|25|20,000 gp|
|Legendary|500,000 gp|17th|50|100,000 gp|

You can create an item from the DMG or create a unique item if you pass it by me first. This lets you add personalized magical items for your character. As with crafting non-magical items, you don't have to pay the cost for a modest lifestyle or pay half for a comfortable lifestyle.

Brewing Potions: This is basically the same as above; except specifically requires proficiency in the herbalists kit or alchemists kit.
![[Pasted image 20231013090758.png]]
#### Crime (XGtE)

You can spend their downtime getting a little extra coin or otherwise committing criminal acts. For example, you can spend your downtime planning and executing a heist. First, you could spend 25 gp or so and a **week** on intel. Then you make, a series of crime related checks, such as **stealth** for not getting caught and **deception** if you get caught. The amount of successful checks determines the outcome of the heist, ranging from being caught and jailed to making it out with a small fortune. However, crime isn't easy and I may choose to put in consequences. The most common ones include police investigations or a bounty on your head. However, if you have a plan or you know you aren't going to be staying in the town for long, then committing some crime isn't so bad.
#### Performing Sacred Rights (DMG) / Religious Services (XGtE)

For all the paladins and clerics out there, you can spend your free time praising your god. If there is a temple near you that is affiliated with your god, you can spend your time performing sacred ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, and sacrifices. If you can do this for at least **ten days**, you'll be rewarded with **inspiration** every day for **2d6 days**. So when the adventure does start, you'll have a leg up on whatever trouble you'll be facing that day. If you are a cleric or paladin or your character is just super religious, I would seriously consider doing this if you have **ten days** to spare.
#### Pit Fighting (XGtE)

Show of your inner macho man in the ring by pit fighting. Pit fights consist of organized, competitive, non-lethal fights. Your DM can choose to enact each of these fights, creating a separate combat encounter for each one, or roll with the rules given in Xanthar's. As with most of XGtE's downtime activities, you make a series of checks that determine the outcome at the end of the **workweek**, ranging from losing all your fights to gaining a small sum of gp. The difference in gambling and other activities is the small amount of risk involved. Unlike committing crimes or gambling, you lose nothing if fail all your roles, so if you are a rough and tough fighter looking to make a little coin, try pit fighting.

#### Recuperating (PHB) / Relaxing (XGtE)

In order to relax, you must be able to maintain a modest lifestyle while you recuperate. After at least a **week** of relaxing, you gain an advantage against any diseases and poisons affecting you, you end any effect that stops you from regaining health, and you can restore one ability score back to its original score if it had been decreased. All in all, if your character is injured or they just need to enjoy some R&R, recuperating is a good way of spending your downtime.
#### Researching (DMG/XGtE)

If you're playing a studious wizard or a cautious ranger, then you'll want to research so you'll be prepared for the troubles ahead. You spend your downtime researching a specific subject or topic that you state at the beginning of your research. I will decide how long it takes to research the subject, and I may require you to make some rolls. In addition, you must pay an extra amount on top of your lifestyle expenses, usually around **1 gp** per day for lore research. At the end of the researching period, I will give information relating to your research, ranging from locations to lore to monster statistics. If you need more intel on what you're facing or the little metagamer inside you wants to get out, try researching for a bit. It never hurts to be prepared.

Researching in the Tower also allows a wizard to learn new spells if the Tower library has access to them. This involves careful study and magical (and often dangerous) experimentation. You can add a wizard spell of 1st level or higher to your spellbook if it's of a level which you have spell slots for. This involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand all the components required to case it perfectly. For each level of the spell, the process takes **1 week** and costs **50 gp**. The costs here represent the money required to buy enough material components to add to your component pouch, the magical ink required to copy the spell, and other miscellaneous experimentation costs.
Note, the Tower doesn't have access to **every** spell in the game. Some are rare or held by other libraries. Check with me about which spells are available or how to acquire other spells.
#### Running a Business (DMG)

Sometimes an adventurer just wants to settle down and run a business for a while. These can range from taverns to stores to exotic services. Depending on the amount of days spent running the business, you can either gain or lose an amount of **gold**, but spending more **days** running a business increases the chance of gaining **gold**. This can lead to unique events such as a rival business taking your customers or a group of edgy adventurers that try to murder someone in your establishment. Opening and running a business is probably one of the simplest things you can do with your downtime, but that doesn't make it a bad option if you have the ability to do it.
#### Scribing Spell Scrolls (XGtE)

If you're like me and worried about wasting your precious spell slots, then you should try your hand at making spell scrolls. In order to make spell scrolls you need proficiency in arcana, the ability to cast spells, time, gold, and any material components needed for the spell. The **time** and amount of **gold** spent depend on the level for the spell; the higher the spell level the more it cost to make. Scribing spell scrolls, in my opinion, is one of the best ways of spellcasters spending their downtime, since it allows them to create a sort of toolbox of spells without having to prepare them. Although it isn't the best for casters with a fixed spell list, like sorcerers and bards, characters that can easily change their spell list, like clerics, druids, and wizards, will greatly benefit since they'll be able to cast spells that they don't have prepared. The only downside is cost, but at higher levels gold is usually not an issue. If you have enough **gold, time, and spells to cast**, try creating some spell scrolls.

#### Selling Magic Items (DMG/XGtE)

Let's say you have come into possession of a cursed item. You obviously don't want it, so your best option is to sell it. You can spend your downtime looking for a buyer. The buyer can range from a wealthy noble to a shady vagabond, but a buyer will give a proposed price proportional to the rarity of the magic item. You can then try to haggle the price, sell the item to them, or keep the item and search for a new buyer. Selling magic items helps you cycle out some of the less useful magic items while making a bit of coin. However, depending on who you sell it to, it could always bite you back later. I usually keep all my magic items, but if something is useless or cursed, selling it is a viable solution.

#### Sowing Rumors (DMG)

If you want to channel your inner "Mean Girls" or you're just a charismatic guy seeking to cause some drama, spreading rumors is an option for you. You can spend your downtime and a little bit of extra **gold** to spread rumors about a specific person or organization. The bigger the place, the longer it takes for word to get around. The rumors can range from scandalous accusations that will tarnish a reputation to good deeds that will make them seem a little bit nicer. If you're playing a social campaign or just really dislike a person, sowing rumors is a fun way of ruining a person's public image.

#### Building A Stronghold (DMG)

So, you have recently come into a bit of land, whether it be through money or murder. You can now build a stronghold on it. Building a stronghold requires **a lot** of time and money and usually should be done after a large adventure. Basically, the bigger the building is, the more it cost and the longer it takes. A small trading post or guildhall might take **5,000 gp** and **60 days** while a grand palace or large castle could take **500,000 gp** and **1,200 days**, or about **3 years**. The stronghold can be built without the character needing to be there, but it takes longer if they aren't. Overall, if you have the time and gold and your party doesn't have a base of operations, a guildhall would probably be the best investment for your party, but I would think twice about building any of the bigger strongholds.
