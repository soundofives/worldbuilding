Arcane Grimoire +3
Robe of Archmagi (+2), AC -> 17
This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe's color corresponds to the [alignment](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Character%20Advancement?expansion=0#toc_14) for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can't attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn't correspond to your alignment.  
  
You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:  
  
• If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.  
  
• You have [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on saving throws against spell and other magical effects.  
  
• Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.

Staff of the Magi:
This staff can be wielded as a magic [quarterstaff](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:quarterstaff?expansion=0#content) that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.  
  
The staff has 50 [charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Magic%20Items?expansion=0#h-Charges) for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.  
  
Spell Absorption: While holding the staff, you have [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).  
  
Spells: While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: [conjure elemental](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:conjure%20elemental?expansion=0#content) (7 charges), [dispel magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:dispel%20magic?expansion=0#content) (3 charges), [fireball](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:fireball?expansion=0#content) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [flaming sphere](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:flaming%20sphere?expansion=0#content) (2 charges), [ice storm](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:ice%20storm?expansion=0#content) (4 charges), [invisibility](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:invisibility?expansion=0#content) (2 charges), [knock](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:knock?expansion=0#content) (2 charges), [lightning bolt](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:lightning%20bolt?expansion=0#content) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [passwall](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:passwall?expansion=0#content) (5 charges), [plane shift](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:plane%20shift?expansion=0#content) (7 charges), [telekinesis](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:telekinesis?expansion=0#content) (5 charges), [wall of fire](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:wall%20of%20fire?expansion=0#content) (4 charges), or [web](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:web?expansion=0#content) (2 charges).  
  
You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: [arcane lock](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:arcane%20lock?expansion=0#content), [detect magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:detect%20magic?expansion=0#content), [enlarge/reduce](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/enlarge%20Reduce?expansion=0#content), [light](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:light?expansion=0#content), [mage hand](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:mage%20hand?expansion=0#content), or [protection from evil and good](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:protection%20from%20evil%20and%20good?expansion=0#content).  
  
Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.  
  
You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random [plane of existence](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Lore:The%20Planes%20of%20Existence?expansion=0#content), avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

Overchannel:
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
