Yrah was the son of Zagyg and friend to Mordenkainen until they had a falling out, and Yrah pursued his mother Tasha in the Abyss. He dominated, and remains charmed, by Fraz Urb'luu.

Fraz Urb'luu, the powerful demon lord trapped in the basement of the Tower, takes on the mask of Yrah to deceive the party.

Fraz's goal is to manipulate his way to freedom and regain his Staff, hidden inside Tasha's Demonomicon.

Fraz attempts to sabotage Zagyg and Tasha at every turn, even though the two are generally separated. Fraz described the lichdom ritual to Nedavir and the other students while under the guise of Tasha, even having one of them write the note for him, signing it ~T.

Now, with the party discovering him, he wants to "prove his usefulness" and gain their trust--and, in doing so, degrade the party's trust in Zagyg.

>**"I like your ideas, and I want to help--as much as I can, that is. Zagyg put me down here because I'm possibly the only person on this plane smarter than him. While I can't escape to help you personally, I can use what's up here to help you.**
>**"Now--you want money. Freedom. Glory. I know things that can give you opportunities."**

Quests from Yrah:
- Travel to Prismeer
- Find a hag coven
- ?

Later, he tries to move directly against Zagyg.

Yrah knows that celestial scholars will be alerted soon - imminently, on the next full moon, of some impending doom (the coming Simifix, which Yrah believes to signal his escape and invasion of the Prime Material with Vecna). The doom will, interpreted differently by different scholars, point towards:

1. Importance of the Demonomicon (that it will play a role)
2. Importance of the Emperor (that someone will attempt to kill him with a great black blade)




"I don't know much about my distant past. I know only what Tasha and Zagyg told me of it. You see, my life didn't go as planned...I'll start with what I've been told. I grew up learning magic from my parents, and eventually I joined my own group of adventurers headed by Mordenkainen. We called ourselves the Citadel of Eight. At some time, I left the circle and sought to enter the Abyss. What for, I cannot say. I have no memory of it. My memory begins with the face of my captor--then and still. Ahmon-Ibor the Sibilant Beast. The Deep Father. The Demogorgon. He...he can control me. Not all the time, only when he sees me. He used me as a tool, but I had enough freedom to continue learning the magic of the Prime Material. I learned things no other mortal knows. I used my power to understand the Planescape and its history. To understand and watch the Prime Material grow. I watched the City and its people grow and change while I remained trapped in Abysm. I became powerful enough to escape Demogorgon and come here, but Zagyg and Tasha saw my return as a threat. They saw the Demogorgon's control over me as a threat. It was enough. They imprisoned me here two hundred years ago."
