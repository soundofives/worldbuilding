Yrah was the son of Zagyg and friend to Mordenkainen until they had a falling out, and Yrah pursued his mother Tasha in the Abyss. He was dominated, and remains charmed, by Fraz Urb'luu.

Fraz Urb'luu, the powerful demon lord trapped in the basement of the Tower, takes on the mask of Yrah to deceive the party.

Fraz's goal is to manipulate his way to freedom and regain his Staff, hidden inside Tasha's Demonomicon.

Fraz attempts to sabotage Zagyg and Tasha at every turn, even though the two are generally separated. Fraz described the lichdom ritual to Nedavir and the other students while under the guise of Tasha, even having one of them write the note for him, signing it ~T.

Now, with the party discovering him, he wants to "prove his usefulness" and gain their trust--and, in doing so, degrade the party's trust in Zagyg.

>**"I like your ideas, and I want to help--as much as I can, that is. Zagyg put me down here because I'm possibly the only person on this plane smarter than him. While I can't escape to help you personally, I can use what's up here to help you.**
>**"Now--you want money. Freedom. Glory. I know things that can give you opportunities."**

Quests from Yrah:
- Travel to Prismeer
- Find a hag coven
- ?

Later, he tries to move directly against Zagyg.

>**"Zagyg is dangerous. Grow too powerful, and he will personally remove you, as evidenced by my current predicament. I'm not the only one he's lashed out at--my mother too, but she escaped before he could imprison her."**

Yrah knows that celestial scholars will be alerted soon - imminently, on the next full moon, of some impending doom (the coming Simifix, which Yrah believes to signal his escape and invasion of the Prime Material with Vecna). The doom will, interpreted differently by different scholars, point towards:

1. Importance of the Demonomicon (that it will play a role)
2. Importance of the Emperor (that someone will attempt to kill him with a great black blade)




"I don't know much about my distant past. I know only what Tasha and Zagyg told me of it. You see, my life didn't go as planned...I'll start with what I've been told. I grew up learning magic from my parents, and eventually I joined my own group of adventurers headed by Mordenkainen. We called ourselves the Citadel of Eight. At some time, I left the circle and sought to enter the Abyss. What for, I cannot say. I have no memory of it. My memory begins with the face of my captor--then and still. Ahmon-Ibor the Sibilant Beast. The Deep Father. The Demogorgon. He...he can control me. Not all the time, only when he sees me. He used me as a tool, but I had enough freedom to continue learning the magic of the Prime Material. I learned things no other mortal knows. I used my power to understand the Planescape and its history. To understand and watch the Prime Material grow. I watched the City and its people grow and change while I remained trapped in Abysm. I became powerful enough to escape Demogorgon and come here, but Zagyg and Tasha saw my return as a threat. They saw the Demogorgon's control over me as a threat. It was enough. They imprisoned me here two hundred years ago."


Revealing Yrah in Muck's visions, with no memory of Muck, will insinuate that Yrah lost/loses  memories too. If that is so, then how does the current-day Yrah know anything about his past? For example, that he's the son of Tasha and Zagyg. Also, how does he know so much about the world and the people in it? A true amnesiac would be clueless to the things that Yrah knows. Perhaps the modern-day Yrah learned how to break his curse. If that's true, then he would have recognized Muck. Perhaps Yrah didn't get "passed around" so much, and instead has been controlled by a single owner since the beginning. When he was captured by Zagyg and Tasha, he was told about his past with them. But he has forgotten the details of the Citadel of Eight, the falling out with Mordenkainen, Muck, etc, up until his Heart was repossessed by a powerful Demon: perhaps his rival, Demogorgon. This, he says, is the true reason he explains he was imprisoned.

Fraz's ability states that if his subjects stop being dominated *by him* then they die. A creature is dominated by Fraz Urb'luu as long as their heart remains out of their body. The domination can only be ended by a Wish spell or equivalent magic. A dominated person who has died cannot be resurrected as long as their heart remains out of their body.
The nature of the domination isn't really described; so let's say that Fraz Urb'luu can control his subjects to the same level as Dominate Monster (ie, he requries a telepathic connection to issue orders and can do so at any time on the same plane, but can take full control without telepathic link. Full control requires that Fraz have the Heart of the target, which he can conjure from the Heart Library instantly). As a rule, when Fraz first dominates anyone, he gives the verbal order, "Never betray me, and never deceive me." Fraz also has complete control over the memories of the Dominated creature while the creature's heart is in his possession.
Anyone that controls the heart of a creature dominated by Fraz can likewise exercise control over the creature, though Fraz's control is paramount.
