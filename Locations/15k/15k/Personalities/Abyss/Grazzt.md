"I live for the moment when I can turn something pure into something perverse."
Hedonism : the ethical theory that pleasure (in the sense of the satisfaction of desires) is the highest good and proper aim of human life.
	-Grazzt is a demon lord that wants to take the idea of the greatest good and proper aim: pleasure, and twist it, turning it dark, destructive, and deadly. He revels in seeing someone reach the highest highs of pleasure then sink when they realize that everything else they cared about is gone.

If I'm so consumed with advancing my own interests, what happens to the public good?
If I'm so wasted by rich foods, drink, and indolence how will I tend my fields, teach my children, and govern the realm?
If I'm convinced that I am absolutely right and – due to character-oriented ethics – worthy of every pleasure, what happens to dissenting voices that besmirch my character?
If I fancy myself a connoisseur, do I really care that my banquet hall's candles are unicorn horns and we'll be serving the last phoenix's egg as an apertif?
If I'm absorbed in indulging my desires, then I'm no longer planning for the long-term, and I'm living moment to moment. What happens when there's a big shock that I coulda shoulda planned for, but there isn't money in my savings to handle that shock?

**His pleasure isn't necessarilly derived from the carnal and hedonistic things that we enjoy, but from seeing others indulging themselves with those things to the point of self destruction.**

I imagine cults of Grazzt looking like Opium Dens- the air is clouded with smoke and curtains to side-rooms wind out in all directions as you go deeper, the sounds of the other cultists and their pursuits of greater and more extreme sensations growing more intense around you with every step downward, so much so that you don't even realize the moment that you step over the threshold that people never leave- so deep into the madness that it consumes them, and they can't pretend to be anything else but a slave to their own desires any longer. Most of them don't even _want_ to have an existence outside of this, and that's the point where their soul belongs to Grazzt completely.

Grazzt in my campaign:
He is the icy-hot consort of Tasha and arch-enemy of Fraz. He controls Muck and uses him to uncover Fraz's deception.
His goals: "six fingered deception". He wants to see Fraz on the brink of success, then tear him down and steal all that he's worked for. He wants the Hollow Staff (he wants the Demonomicon destroyed). He wants the Abyss to himself. He wants to see the Last and First City crumble into a filthy den of his worship.
