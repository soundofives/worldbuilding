Muck and Yrah were friends, and part of the early Citadel of Eight, long before its members grew powerful and famous. They found out that the Prince of Demons, Fraz Urb'luu, was working with someone on the Prime Material to open a gate to the Abyss and start a new Blood War.
They fell out with Mordenkainen in a bad way, leaving on bad terms. They traveled to the Abyss via borrowed magic, to the realm of Fraz Urb'luu, to attempt to bind him. They lost. Yrah and Muck both had their hearts ripped out and were claimed by Fraz as slaves. After that, Yrah and Muck served Fraz as slaves until Fraz was summoned to the Prime Material by Zagyg and Tasha and bound. Demogorgon, Orcus, and Grazzt came and tore Hollow's Heart apart, taking Yrah and Muck with them.
Muck went to Orcus, who was eventually killed by Demogorgon. In the chaos until Orcus' rejuvination, Muck passed from his realm and ended up in the Blood War. He passed through the hands of several devils, eventually being given to the Carnival l'Morai. From there to a dwarf merchant. Then a human smith in the Prime Material. Then to the vampiric leaders of the Thieves Guild, his current masters.

1. Your time as a young boy outside of Sinisa. You were close to nature and the animals.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >A golden haze comes into your mind. You're running through meadows, where the flowers whispered secrets and the ancient trees cradled the wind. You are a young boy, close with the world around you. The sun-kissed fields were your playground, and the rustle of leaves, your lullaby. A curious fawn, unafraid, would nuzzle your hand, and the songbirds wove melodies that echoed the rhythm of the land. Those were the days when the language of the wild became your first tongue, and the patterns of animal tracks etched memories that would eventually vanish.
2. Your move to the City, where you met a golden-skinned elf mage named Yrah.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >You've just come to the bustling City, its smells and life new to you. The air crackled with possibilities. Amidst the bustling streets, you caught a glimpse of a golden-skinned elf. Their presence seemed to shimmer with energy, drawing you in like a moth to a flame. You were drawn to him. The scene vanishes...you're speaking with him in a tavern, his words were spells, each sentence weaving a connection that transcended the ordinary. In that moment, surrounded by the urban symphony, you felt the pulse of the City synchronize with the enchantment of meeting this elf, Yrah, the golden mage whose presence marked the beginning of a journey into the unknown.
3. Yrah introduces you to Mordenkainen, and you join the Citadel of Eight.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >You stand in a run-down house. Yrah and a few others are here, chatting and drinking. One man, youthful but stern, sits across from you, a simple drink in his hand. "So, Muck. What do you say? Come with us? Turn the Citadel of Seven into the Citadel of Eight?" A voice called from another, though the sound was distant and warped. "Mordenkainen, come, have another round!" The air hummed with arcane potential as the Citadel of Eight unfolded before you, its walls echoing with the legacy of renowned wizards. Mordenkainen's gaze didn't leave your face. It held the weight of knowledge even then.
4. You and Yrah discover a horrible secret about the Abyss.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >In the dim-lit chamber, shadows danced as you and Yrah. He held a tome in front of him. Neither of you could speak. No words could capture what you'd found. The air thickened. The horrific secret unraveled in your mind like a sinister tapestry. In that moment, the boundaries of reality seemed to warp, and a distant voice--no, not distant. Next to you. Yrah whispered, "Another Blood War. This would mean the end of all things..."
1. A heated argument between you and Yrah and Mordenkainen. You leave the Citadel of Eight and brave the Abyss.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The stone chamber of the castle was hot. Voices rang around you as Yrah and Mordenkainen fought. Words clashed, harsh and unforgiving, resonating within the hallowed walls that had once felt like home. Now they seemed alien. Yrah, holding a tome with furrowed brows. The argument's heat refused to wane. You left first. The Citadel. Mordenkainen. Bigby, Riggby, Robilar, Tenser, Serten. There was only one place to go: the Deepness Gloam. The Abyss.
1. A view of Yrah, a hole in his chest and a heart in a hand. A flash of pain, a hand sinking into your chest and ripping out your heart.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The air is on fire. Your eyes are on fire. You can barely see through the pain and tears and horror. Yrah. You see Yrah. Finally--no. Wait. Something is wrong. He stands across from you in the flaming hurricaine, a gaping hole in his chest, blood poring down his robes. A voice rings from everywhere around you: "Your life is mine!" A flash of light. Pain. A huge hand is sinking into your chest, wrenching away your heart. The air itself seemed to recoil from your lungs. Everything goes black.
2. A view out of the balcony of Fraz' fortress in Hallow Heart. A scar on your chest. Yrah next to you.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The bleak country was unlike home. It seemed wrong. Empty. Fake. Your chest still hurt--the scar was yet fresh. You look up, and hear a familiar voice next to you. "Mac, what do we do now?"
1. The sack of Hollow's Heart, possession of your Heart by Orcus--a sudden blackness in your mind. Amnesia.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The bleak country, empty, fake, wrong, was no more. Creatures flooded the fields. Demons horded the streets. They pulled down the towers and tore up the roads. You fled. You hid. Where was Yrah? You lost him. You look up from your hiding spot--a huge demon towered in front of you, two vile heads screaming, and four vile tentacles ripping at anything in their grasp. Beside him, a sight just as horrible. A colossal figure, his visage is a grotesque amalgamation of horned skull and decaying flesh, crowned with a diadem of dark authority. Malevolent flames flicker in the hollow sockets of his eyeless skull, casting an unholy radiance that chills the bravest hearts. Orcus.
1. Another battle, the destruction of Orcus. A balor takes your Heart. Black.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >Orcus lay in front of you, flayed to pieces. His massive body was a mess of gore and ruin. You know this had happened before. Orcus would be back--but not for some time. An elf with skin as black as night hovered over him, the lower half of her body melding into the abdomen of a giant white spider. She held the great spine, the Wand of Orcus, in her hands. Another creature, a huge horned demon wielding flaming sword and flaming whip, reached down into the mess that was Orcus and picked up a bloody heart from among the carnage. He places it in a dark sack. A new hand. Your vision fades to black.
2. The Blood War, the balor is killed and a Devil takes your heart. Black.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >You awaken to a battle raging around you. Swords, chains, violent struggle. Blood and carnage and screams--the Demon of the flaming sword and flaming whip stands above you in a wrenching dual. The endless battlefields of Archeron were as welcoming as you expected. You were told to fight, and so you fight. You duck the bouts of flame and the swords of the devil legionnaires. In an instant a Devil's spear pierces your master's heart, and he falls. The Devil leans down--a new hand. Your vision fades to black.
3. An Amnizu collector buys your heart, you are introduced to his menagerie.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >You look around the room, a menagerie of the grotesque. An assembly of fiendish curiosities. Nightmarish amalgams writhe and squirm within crystalline cages, their anguished howls harmonizing with the foul symphony of this new Devil's malevolent dominion. You were told to wait. So you wait. You hear the fat, vile collector from across the room: "A deal. Dazzath never passes on an opportunity such as this! You say you acquired this one from the body of the Bloodlord himself? Now, the bag, please...". A new Hand touches the Heart. Black.
4. Your heart and you are stolen by a White Abishai devil, you escape from the window of the Menagerie.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The rooftop was cold, the rank air cold against your skin. You hadn't felt it in so, so long. The Iron City stretched away from you, the window of Dazzath's menagerie broken open behind you. The white scales of your new captor glint under his hood. His hand slips beneath his cloak, pocketing something. He whispers in a slithery voice, "Come, flesh thing, we must go before Dazzath awakes." You don't know this creature. In fact, strangely, you feel you don't remember anything at all.
1. You are ushered into a Monastery of Dis, and your Heart is sold. You are a cleaning slave.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The Abashai, Drar'guroch, stood in front of you, pushing at the doors of the grey monastery. "The monks should pay a fair price for you, flesh thing." His hand slips into his pocket, and you feel a pressure come over you. "Come." The word washes over you, compelling you to obey. The door opens, a skeletal figure in a filthy gray habit stood in the doorway. The skeleton was warped and spined. It gestured for you and Drar'guroch to come in. Rows of balconies line the walls, occupied by a couple of dozen hooded monks. At the far end of the nave, a throne resembling a twisted metal captain's chair rises from a metallic dais backed by an ornate arch. There sits another bone devil. The Grand Master wears a patchwork leather robe and a gleaming crown, and it carries a scepter set with odd crystal bumps and metal flanges. With its other hand, the devil taps the arm of the throne, showing off nails set with gleaming metallic shards. "You have something to offer, Drar'guroch?"
![[Pasted image 20231108223030.png]]

1. Two strange men, Mr. Witch and Mr. Light, purchase your Heart for their carnival.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The doors of the monastery open. You are dressed in shabby cleaner's robes, a gray habit even more torn than the robes of the skeletal monks. A flamboyant elf grins from ear to ear as he stands in the doorway, leading with a theatrical bow. "Please sir, might you welcome a few destitute travelers for the night? I am [Mister Light](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/bestiary.html#mister%20light_wbtw), and this is my associate, [Mister Witch](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/bestiary.html#mister%20witch_wbtw)." He gestures to a stocky elf lounging against the pillar nearby. [Mister Witch](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/bestiary.html#mister%20witch_wbtw) nods to you and doffs his top hat.

2. A scene at the Carnival l'Morai. You meet Amelia the Vampire. She falls in love.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >The carnival is busy tonight. The darkness overhead bears down on you tonight like all nights, but the time here has been exciting. You don't remember what came before your time here, but you remember leaving the Iron City of Dis behind you as you rode away in the cart with the two elves, Mister Light and Mister Witch. You step through the throngs of people; you had a job, yes. But tonight you had some time to wander off. You step into a quieter tent towards the back of the circus. "Finally," a voice says in the damp darkness. Your eyes adjust, and you see Amelia, her black wings folded behind her and her white fangs glistening in through the dark. "Come on! Let's sit for a while. They won't notice we're gone." You want to--you really do--but something deep down rises up. A compulsion. You have to get back to work.
3. Amelia helps you escape--but you don't remember her anymore.
>[!quote] Memory
>Amelia whispers in a hushed tone, "Come on! We can finally get out of this place!" You slink through a maze of carnival tents, the lights and sounds swirling around you. Ahead: the tent that held your Providence. "I'll slip in and grab it. You keep watch." You did just that. The dark of the Shadowfell seemed to cling to you, not banished but only made more corporeal by the dancing lights around the carnival. Music, cheers, the smell of roasting meat. A pressure washes over you. Everything goes black. 
   
5. You are given to a Dwarf Merchant, but after some time given to a smith in the Prime Material.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >A pretty girl with white fangs and bat-like black wings nudges you forward. "Go on. It's not fair, I know. But I can't do this. I can't control you like this." She steps away, gesturing you towards the dwarf traveler a few feet away from you. The dry grass at your feet rustles in the breeze coming over the hill. You look towards the girl, confused. Who was she? Did you know her? Who is the dwarf? Nothing makes sense anymore.
6. A scene apprenticed to a smith, but you move to the City.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >Tornir called to you from the forge window, smoke following his voice as he fed the flames. "Mick, I think it's time we move to the City. We've saved up enough, don't you think?" The coastal air was cold this time of year. His voice called again, absently, almost talking to himself like he usually does. "We could find a place. Settle in and stop this travelling. I think it'd be nice. I'm getting old, ya know, and my knees can't take all the walking anymore. I just think it'd be nice. You'd be able to find new things, too. You don't have to help old Tornir till your hair grays like mine... You could open a shop of your own! Hah! Wouldn't that be grand!" His voice drifted off. A songbird called from a nearby tree, and something stirred deep inside you. A memory...
1. You and your smith fall on hard times--he is mugged and your heart is taken by the Vampire head of the Thieves Guild.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >Tornir sat bloody and beaten in the floor of his shop, the prismatic light of Touchstone's Star spinning through the windows every few seconds to light the scene in front of you. The thugs stood menacingly, swinging clubs aimlessly. A few were tearing apart the place, ransacking it for anything of worth. You sat, broken. Your vision blurred, dipping in and out of consciousness. You hear one of the thugs from another room, "Boss, you gotta see this..." A tall, slender man steps up to the threshold of the house, and one of the thugs bows and gestures him inside. He pulls his long hair back over his shoulder, revealing a pale face of perfect skin. His clothes were fine and dark, sleek and fashionable, a tophat on his head. His eyes were bright, but disinterested. His voice was low, "Yes? Bring it here." The thug emerged from the back room carrying is small burlap sack, stained with blood. It seemed to shift, as if something inside were moving. The pale and slender elf took the sack and peered inside, his eyes widening. Tornir stirred in the corner, "Please, no. Not that...I promise, I'll pay. I'll pay whatever you need. I can forge you a weapon like no other! A dagger from the Unraveling! Anything!" The elf sneered. "No, I think this will do." Your world goes black.
2. You are passed to the Vampire's consort and told to infiltrate the Tower.
   >[!quote] Memory
   >"Now Muck..." your vision opens in a candlelit room, a comfortable and dark parlor. Your body is sore. Scarred. Suddenly, it feels as if you've seen the weight of a hundred years. The man in front of you, the Master Thief Rilan, beckoned you. His face was pale as always, his fangs playing at the edge of a blood-stained goblet at his mouth. A woman in a sleek silk dress lounges across his shoulders, half on him and half on the plush couch. A burlap sack stained with blood set on a dark wooden stand next to them. It seemed to shift, as if something inside was moving. The woman, his consort Testra, eyed it. "We have a new task for you. A new job...and this one will pay out very, very well. The Tower of the Mad Mage has just arrived outside of Sinisa. We want you to...well, help us get inside. Now, of course, we can't have you knowing all this. So this requires a change in management..." The woman reaches down and grabs the burlap sack. A new hand. Your vision fades to black.

Zagyg and Tasha caught on to Yrah's plan and realized that what he told them about Fraz was true. They worked together to bind Fraz to the Prime Material and delay the plan, though in a way they only brought the Hollow Staff closer to Vecna's grasp.

When Fraz was pulled from the Abyss and bound, Hollow Heart was invaded and torn apart by Demogorgon, Grazzt, Orcus, and other lords. In the great sack, Yrah and Muck were separated and their Hearts were claimed by different demons: Yrah went to Demogorgon, Muck to Orcus.

A civil war ensued between the Demon Lords, and at one point Orcus was destroyed. During this destruction, Yrah is seen again in the service of Demogorgon. Eventually he would return as Tenebrous, but at this point he lost control of Muck's Heart. His Heart passed to a balor marching towards the Gate of Pazunia to fight in the Blood War. His Captor was killed and Muck's Heart was passed to a Devil soldier. His Heart was passed around between devils quickly, many times over the course of a century:
1. an Amnizu collector,
2. stolen by a white Abisahai,
3. sold to a monastery of Dis,
4. sold to the wandering carnival in the Grey Wastes, the Shadowfell Carnival. He stayed with the Carnival l'Morai for some time while it was still run by Mr. Witch and Mr. Light.
5. escaped with Amelia the Vampire, who fell in love with him, and helped him escape, though when she took his Heart he forgot her. She tried to reconcile this, but hated controlling him. Unable to continue this way, but wanting a better life for him, she passed his Heart to a kindly dwarf merchant they met in the Unravelling between the Shadowfell and the Seven Heavens.
6. The Dwarf, wanting to give Muck a life of peace, gave his Heart to a smith in a small town on the Prime Material.
7. The smith eventually moved to the Last and First City with Muck, but fell into hard times with the Thieves Guild and had Muck's Heart taken from him.
8. The Vampiric master of the Thieves Guild held onto Muck's heart for some time, using him as a footpad in Touchstone. The Vampire realized Muck's curse could be more useful. He passed off the Heart to his consort, and they contracted him out with the Brothers' Company. They want him to infiltrate the Tower, and when the time is right they'll use their power to control him to let them in and steal the wealth of the Tower.

Takes your heart, forever Charmed by the possessor. Die if Charm **breaks**--and you cannot Charm yourself. If he possesses his Heart while the Charm is still active, he dies. The Charm can only be broken by Power Word: Heal, Wish, True Resurrection, or similar magic.

Revealing Yrah in Muck's visions, with no memory of Muck, will insinuate that Yrah lost/loses  memories too. If that is so, then how does the current-day Yrah know anything about his past? For example, that he's the son of Tasha and Zagyg. Also, how does he know so much about the world and the people in it? A true amnesiac would be clueless to the things that Yrah knows. Perhaps the modern-day Yrah learned how to break his curse. If that's true, then he would have recognized Muck. Perhaps Yrah didn't get "passed around" so much, and instead has been controlled by a single owner since the beginning. When he was captured by Zagyg and Tasha, he was told about his past with them. But he has forgotten the details of the Citadel of Eight, the falling out with Mordenkainen, Muck, etc, up until his Heart was repossessed by a powerful Demon: perhaps his rival, Demogorgon. This, he says, is the true reason he explains he was imprisoned.
