Friend of Yrah? Then, why wouldn't Yrah have recognized him?
Fraz would have known to do that.
Unless... Fraz is playing as Yrah post-hollowing. That would be pretty complex.

Muck and Yrah were friends, and part of the early Citadel of Eight, long before its members grew powerful and famous. They found out that the Prince of Demons, Fraz Urb'luu, was working with someone on the Prime Material to open a gate to the Abyss and start a new Blood War.
They fell out with Mordenkainen in a bad way, leaving on bad terms. They traveled to the Abyss via borrowed magic, to the realm of Fraz Urb'luu, to attempt to bind him. They lost. Yrah and Muck both had their hearts ripped out and were claimed by Fraz as slaves.

Zagyg and Tasha caught on to Yrah's plan and realized that what he told them about Fraz was true. They worked together to bind Fraz to the Prime Material and delay the plan, though in a way they only brought the Hollow Staff closer to Vecna's grasp.

When Fraz was pulled from the Abyss and bound, Hollow Heart was invaded and torn apart by Demogorgon, Grazzt, Orcus, and other lords. In the great sack, Yrah and Muck were separated and their Hearts were claimed by different demons: Yrah went to Demogorgon, Muck to Orcus.

A civil war ensued between the Demon Lords, and at one point Orcus was destroyed. During this destruction, Yrah is seen again in the service of Demogorgon. Eventually he would return as Tenebrous, but at this point he lost control of Muck's Heart. His Heart passed to a balor marching towards the Gate of Pazunia to fight in the Blood War. His Captor was killed and Muck's Heart was passed to a Devil soldier. His Heart was passed around between devils quickly, many times over the course of a century:
1. an Amnizu collector,
2. stolen by a white Abisahai,
3. sold to a monastery of Dis,
4. sold to the wandering carnival in the Grey Wastes, the Shadowfell Carnival. He stayed with the Carnival l'Morai for some time while it was still run by Mr. Witch and Mr. Light.
5. escaped with Amelia the Vampire, who fell in love with him, and helped him escape, though when she took his Heart he forgot her. She tried to reconcile this, but hated controlling him. Unable to continue this way, but wanting a better life for him, she passed his Heart to a kindly dwarf merchant they met in the Unravelling between the Shadowfell and the Seven Heavens.
6. The Dwarf, wanting to give Muck a life of peace, gave his Heart to a smith in a small town on the Prime Material.
7. The smith eventually moved to the Last and First City with Muck, but fell into hard times with the Thieves Guild and had Muck's Heart taken from him.
8. The Vampiric master of the Thieves Guild held onto Muck's heart for some time, using him as a footpad in Touchstone. The Vampire realized Muck's curse could be more useful. He passed off the Heart to his consort, and they contracted him out with the Brothers' Company. They want him to infiltrate the Tower, and when the time is right they'll use their power to control him to let them in and steal the wealth of the Tower.

Takes your heart, forever Charmed by the possessor. Die if Charm **breaks**--and you cannot Charm yourself. If he possesses his Heart while the Charm is still active, he dies. The Charm can only be broken by Power Word: Heal, Wish, True Resurrection, or similar magic.

Revealing Yrah in Muck's visions, with no memory of Muck, will insinuate that Yrah lost/loses  memories too. If that is so, then how does the current-day Yrah know anything about his past? For example, that he's the son of Tasha and Zagyg. Also, how does he know so much about the world and the people in it? A true amnesiac would be clueless to the things that Yrah knows. Perhaps the modern-day Yrah learned how to break his curse. If that's true, then he would have recognized Muck. Perhaps Yrah didn't get "passed around" so much, and instead has been controlled by a single owner since the beginning. When he was captured by Zagyg and Tasha, he was told about his past with them. But he has forgotten the details of the Citadel of Eight, the falling out with Mordenkainen, Muck, etc, up until his Heart was repossessed by a powerful Demon: perhaps his rival, Demogorgon. This, he says, is the true reason he explains he was imprisoned.
He will reveal:
"I don't know much about my distant past. I know only what Tasha and Zagyg told me of it. You see, my life didn't go as planned...I'll start with what I've been told. I grew up learning magic from my parents, and eventually I joined my own group of adventurers headed by Mordenkainen. We called ourselves the Citadel of Eight. At some time, I left the circle and sought to enter the Abyss. What for, I cannot say. I have no memory of it. My memory begins with the face of my captor--then and still. Ahmon-Ibor the Sibilant Beast. The Deep Father. The Demogorgon. He...he can control me. Not all the time, only when he sees me. He used me as a tool, but I had enough freedom to continue learning the magic of the Prime Material. I learned things no other mortal knows. I used my power to understand the Planescape and its history. To understand and watch the Prime Material grow. I watched the City and its people grow and change while I remained trapped in Abysm. I became powerful enough to escape Demogorgon and come here, but Zagyg and Tasha saw my return as a threat. They saw the Demogorgon's control over me as a threat. It was enough. They imprisoned me here two hundred years ago."
