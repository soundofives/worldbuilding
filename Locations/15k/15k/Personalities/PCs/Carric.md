Summary:
- Unarmed attacks by Carric do 1d8 + 1 + STR (unarmed fighting)
- Advantage on attacks and grapples against creatures grappled by him (grappler)
- At the start of his turn, grappled creatures automatically take 1d4 damage. (unarmed fighter)
- Carric can do a second grapple check against an already grappled creature to pin it, which restrains it. (grappler)
- If he hits a creature with an attack (or grapple) he can use a superiority dice to do a grapple as a bonus action, adding superiority to the athletics check. (grappling maneuver)

Escaping the grapple requires a contested Athletics / Acrobatics check OR a shove. Shove is a contested athletics check as ONE part of a multiattack. Acrobatics has disadvantage when pinned + restrained.

**RAW Grappled condition:**
- A grappled creature’s [speed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=0#toc_1) becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is [incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_6) (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the _[thunderwave](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Thunderwave?expansion=0#content)_ spell.
**RAW Prone condition:**
- A prone creature’s only [movement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=0#content) option is to [crawl](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=0#toc_5), unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on [attack rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_32).
- An [attack roll](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_32) against the creature has [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2).
**RAW Restrained condition:**
- A restrained creature’s [speed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=0#toc_1) becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- [Attack rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_32) against the creature have [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2), and the creature’s attack rolls have [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2).
- The creature has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on [Dexterity](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_17) [saving throws](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_35).

His grappling abilities:
- Unarmed Fighting Style
	- When wielding no shields or other weapons, your punches do **1d8 + STR.**
	- At the start of your turn, automatically deal **1d4 damage to creatures grappled by you.**
- Grappler Feat
	- You have **advantage on creatures grappled by you.**
	- You can use your (whole) action to pin a creature grappled by you by making another grapple check. If you succeed, both you and the creature are **restrained**
- Grappling Strike: Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and then try to **grapple the target as a bonus action**. Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check.

So how does this all add together:
On a regular turn, Carric has a few options:
1. Use his attack to grapple a creature, reducing its speed to zero and giving Carric advantage on attacks (including next grapple checks!). With advantage on attacks, Carric can follow up by beating the hell out of the grappled creature, (1d8 + STR + 1d4) or move forward and pin them, which Carric has advantage on doing. When they're pinned, they have disadvantage on attacks and DEX saving throws (I rule that this also gives them disadvantage on taking the escape action if they go the DEX route), but Carric loses his advantage on attacks (he's restrained too, so he has disadvantage that cancels out to just a normal roll). The benefit here is that all attacks against the target have advantage, even ranged attacks (which is different from doing a prone grapple)
2. (before Extra Attack) have an ally shove a creature, then grapple the prone creature. All melee attacks have advantage, and they can't stand up. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, but does not have disadvantage to escape the grapple like in the Pinned scenario. (after Extra Attack) Carric could shove the creature himself
3. Use Grappling Strike to attack, damage AND grapple as a bonus action. This could mean just dealing some extra damage and also grappling, or it could send the target directly to being pinned if Carric uses his first attack to grapple. Speed grapple scenario.

A grappled creature can use its whole action to escape with a contested Athletics or Acrobatics check (really the only option for quick or wiggly creatures, the Acrobatics check has disadvantage when the creature is pinned, but the STR based Athletics does not). Or, it can try to Shove Carric with a contested Athletics check as one of its attacks (better option for stronger creatures).
