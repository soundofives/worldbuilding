Tuition varied widely, from absurdly expensive to extremely cheap.

At Paris, Oxford, Cambridge, Bologna--and probably everywhere else--there was no tuition or entrance fee as we understand them. Instead, when a student arrived he had to have his name enrolled in the _matricula_ (i.e., class list) of a master (i.e., professor) to whom he paid a fee to attend his lectures. (At Cambridge, he had to have his name on a list within 15 days or face arrest.) Some lecturers charged more than others; those who lectured on required texts got more than those who lectured on secondary texts, but the fees were fixed by university statutes. Like today, “graduate school” (where you took a master’s degree in law or medicine) cost the most. Again like today, law and medicine were considered very profitable professions for which it was worth spending a lot to acquire a degree--so profitable in fact that Pope Innocent II in 1130 forbade monks and regular canons to study them because they were "_scientiae lucrativae_” or “profitable disciplines” (Walther p. 104--see below). At the law school in Bologna, one late 13th-century professor calculated that students would need 100 Lire (= pounds) annually for 5 years, “an immense sum of money,” as Helmut Walther puts it. To that end, this same professor loaned students money. By comparison, in 1495 a lecturer in the Faculty of Arts at Caen could charge only 7.5 solidi per student.

As elsewhere, Bologna (where students had a lot of say in how the university was run) fixed the annual fees students had to pay teachers. In 1405, law professors could demand no more than 40 solidi annually; grammar masters could charge only 30 solidi, unless they threw in lodgings, which earned them 10 more solidi. (This is still quite a lot of money. There’s hardly a way to suggest what these prices might be in modern terms, but here’s a very rough idea: in late 13th-century England, a cow cost 6 shillings--the same as solidi. But there were local solidi minted for towns all over, so the sum was not fixed absolutely.)

Students from the mendicant orders who increasingly attended schools by the mid-13th century were usually taught by masters from those orders, who would waive fees. They would also be housed in their order's monasteries (called convents in this case, but no women in them). By the late Middle Ages there would be the occasional scholarships endowed by wealthy patrons of a college. These were for “poor” students (_pauperes_) but this meant not the really poor and destitute but young men who couldn’t afford university expenses.

Students' fixed costs would be room and board, which would vary depending on where you were. As universities developed, they usually made arrangements with townspeople to rent rooms to students at a fixed rate. (There were no dormitories for students until late in the Middle Ages, and these were few.) In some case (e.g., Bologna) a student might pay his master both his teaching fee and live in the master’s lodgings for extra money. Beyond these--and maybe the occasional book--the main fee would be the one you paid when you graduated: fees for your oral defense and inception and for the banquet that new graduates were expected to hold for the other masters whose ranks they had now joined. (Someone was a “graduate,” by the way, because he was allowed to ascend the steps (_gradus_) to sit in the master’s chair, the seat from which he was now allowed to teach.

The Last and First City has a lot of wealthy people who are pressured to show off.



This is an estimate of minimum income to qualify for a certain lifestyle. This minimum income would strain some of the wealthier classes, which have practically no income cap. Some aristocrats will easily earn thousands of gold per month.

Generally, that profit isn't the only way that people can save up. This doesn't count for random sales or smart budgeting.

**Magical university is expensive.**
One year's lectures, room, board, and other education at a prestigious mundane university can cost 800 gold pieces every year--ten years of pure income from an unskilled worker. A magical university can cost hundreds of gold pieces more, as they have to pay for a number of mercenaries to support the school. Let's say 1,000 - 1,200 gp annually. You can think of this as being enough to purchase 100 - 130 horses, or several hundred cows. 

A modest merchant could save up his entire life to send a child to university.
