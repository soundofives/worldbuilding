##### On an undead army
>Kalma raised an army of the undead to conquer the vast territories of the Shadaean Empire.  The undead solved some of the enduring problems of a conquering empire: the massive expense of maintaining a living military and the societal tensions of levying extreme taxes.
>Using undead as your military, however, is not without its caveats. Undead -- especially those easily raised (Shadows, Spectres, Wraiths) have an inescapable craving for the vitality of the living. They *need* to kill.
>Other undead, (skeletons, zombies, mummies) do not have this same craving, and so are more easily integrated into a longterm society.
>So...How do you support the insatiable desire to slaughter the living within your massive army? You could keep conquering, killing wider swathes of people. But this breeds more of these undead--shadows, wraiths, etc, which further increases the severity of your problem. You could...
>1. raise the army, use it, then somehow forcefully destroy it, requiring you to re-raise your next army.
>2. raise the army, use it, then sequester it. The undead would build up a raging fever of desire, making them difficult to control, but they technically would survive.
>3. allow the army to grow indefinitely. Station the shadows along the borders of society and allow them to raid outwards. As they deplete the surroundings they'll continue to push the borders of the empire further and further.
>	1. This could quickly get out of hand, provoking unwanted wars and unintentional slaughters.
>4. feed the army with livestock, prisoners of war, and the worst criminals, but not to the point of allowing the prisoners or livestock to die. Shadows feed on strength, spectres and wraiths drain hitpoint maximum. Prisons can be kept docile by allowing the army to feed on the prisoners to the point of complete weakness, but not death. This could sustain a decent working army which could be grown in times of need by Kalma or his generals as Shadow Dragons.
>Great! The last one is what happens. Military bastions keep livestock barns for feeding. Long-term prisons are relegated to the outskirts of society as well, where shadows and wraiths feed on the prisoners. This creates some discontent in society, though not too much. Small crimes are NOT punished in this way, only bad crimes.
>Society also has vampires. The vampires need flesh or blood to sustain them, and their condition is hereditary. They usually feed on livestock.

##### Undeath in society
>*"Life in the Last and First City is life spent enjoying luxury, where the fruits of all the world are available to you. It is not until after your death that you give your service to the Empire as a cog in the great machine."*
