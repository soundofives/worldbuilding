Planes can be connected in several ways:

1. Injunction
2. Astral Bridge

In the case of an injunction, two planes are physically conjoined at several points. Rarely does a true injunction only happen at one point on a plane.

In the case of an Astral Bridge connection, the injunction is with the astral plane that then injuncts with the other plane. The injunction point looks like a natural injunction between those planes, but has *astral space* that must be traversed between the two planes.

How about spells like *plane shift*? These spells allow "instantaneous" teleportation between planes. How does this work, if planes usually need to be connected via astral bridgeways? These spells instantaneously manipulate the astral plane. For these spells to work, the two planes must be connected via the astral plane in some way (all planes generally are, though some small demiplanes or fragments might not be). They create an "astral whip" which is an infinitesimal bit of astral spacetime that whips the caster across the planescape, injuncting and connecting them to the target plane. These spells cause *fis* and *fos* gate effects:

-A gate has a _fos_, the source, and an _fis,_ the destination, for any given transaction.

-Energy is always conserved (physical material is dangerous to send). There are measured reactions to material transfer for the _fos_ and _fis_:

_Fos_ events, signaling that something has left the plane, “profection effect”: formation of storms, increase in temperature and spontaneous combustion, genesis of matter and reconstruction of bodies (healing), shock waves, spontaneous genesis of souls.

_Fis_ events, signaling that something has arrived in the plane, “advention effect”: drops in temperature, dissolution of matter, spontaneous deaths (necrotic energy bursts).
