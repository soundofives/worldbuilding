Fraz is the origin of the power of summoning demon lords. He's the only one of the Demon Lords that has been mentioned to have that ability--I judge that the Hollow Bone has this ability. He shares the secret of this power with Tasha who has it in the Demonomicon. Even with the Staff, summoning a Demon Lord is no easy feat, and it often requires some obscure ritual feat, along the lines of:

- The first kiss of a mother upon her newborn babe.
    
- The memory of a lover's death.
    
- All of the charity found in the heart of a pious monk.
    
- The teeth grinding fear of abandonment.
    
- The sound of the last birdsong before winter.
    
- The tears of a child the first time they see death.
    
- The broken will of a fallen champion.

There are 11 notable Demon Lords.
*Demon Lords that CANNOT teleport:*
Yeenoghu (trapped)
Jubilex (trapped)
Baphomet (trapped)
Pazuzu (trapped)

*Demon Lords that CAN teleport:*
Demogorgon (trapped)
Fraz
Grazzt
Lolth
Orcus
Zuggtmoy (trapped)

*Unknown:*
Malcanthet (trapped)

Dagon, Kostchtchie (imprisoned in Avernus), Malcanthet, Obox-ob, Pale Night, Sess'Innek (isolated and unknown until Mordenkainen became an Abyssal explorer)
So... Malcanthet (former lover of Grazzt, until after Tasha. Then Grazzt cast her out). Obox-Ob, Dagon, and Pale Night are ancient and irrelevant.

Methods:
1. Glyph of Warding: Forbiddance (no save)
2. Glyph of Warding: Magic Circle (no save)
3. 3-5x - Glyph of Warding: Feeblemind (legendary resistance suck)
4. Summon
5. Planar Binding - Demonomicon (*save*) / Containment - Demonomicon (*save*)

The Demon Lords that can teleport essentially negate the usefulness of Magic Circle. They can attempt to escape every round, which makes a 1 hour binding time essentially impossible. Fraz was only bound because he wanted to be.
For Fraz's plan of the destruction of Orcus, Orcus needs to be fought and killed. Magic Circle can delay him, but only for a few seconds. Feeblemind can suck a legendary resistence. With his Wand he is essentially unbeatable--he can create literally 4 liches on his first turn. Or Nighwalkers. Etc. Right now, he is reduced to his shade state and without his Wand. He is slowly being regenerated, but some of his cults are working to hasten the process. In his shadow state he cannot use his wand to create undead.

Demons are bound to their Realm. A demon and its realm are synonymous. To summon a demon is also to summon its Realm, which can injunct with the minds of those that deal regularly (or even briefly) with the demon. For example, the summoned demon can burrow into the summoner's mind and possibly possess them. *This* is the source of the main danger to the Demonomicon--if the book is on the same plane as its user, the demons trapped inside it have their realms injuncted into the mind of the user, allowing them to attempt a possession. In the case of the binding of Demogorgon, he possessed a piece of essentia that allowed the Gaping Maw to injunct on the minds of all nearby, and even brought the Infinite Fear to Prismeer. A large-scale Abyssal injunction began, which required the binding of Tsojcanth to stop (the injunction was completely re-routed to the mind of Tsojcanth, destroying his mind. He is powerful enough to survive, though, and remains a prisoner of Tasha to this day)
When Tasha and Zagyg summoned Fraz, both Zagyg and Tasha experienced injunctions from Hollow's Heart. It corrupted Tasha and turned her to evil. After she left, the injunction drove Zagyg mad: he's got Fraz whispering constantly into his head, gorging on his fears and sorrows. Until Fraz is released, the injunction cannot be broken. Fraz's presence has also caused an injunction with the Infinite Fear, but not to the same scale as Demogorgon and his essentia.

More...a demon's Realm is always injuncting with the Infinite Fear. If a demon remains on any plane for long enough, the injunction of their Realm can evolve into a full injunction with the Infinite Fear, which can create new demonic Realms and breed new demons from the minds of those nearby. In this way, a demon's presence alone corrupts a plane. Symptoms of the injunction: madness, shadows that are far too deep, and the natural world seems to recoil from the abyssal presence. Plants become twisted, leering faces appear in leaves. Animals grow crazed and rabid. Both will wither and die. Water becomes tainted and poisonous, and the weather might fluctuate to extremes unnatural for the region.

The Tower moves around expressly for this reason: the injunction with the Infinite Fear can never grow too strong if the Tower moves around. Each time it moves, the cleric hallows the ground to call upon divine power to cure the early injunction. Further, the Emperor's shadows help to hide the deepening shadows of the infinite dark.

1. Zagyg's madness
2. dying plants, abyssal plants
3. dying animals, sickening animals
4. evil shadows!

Demon worship has existed for around 2000 years. The worship is entirely dependant on the ability to travel across planes and manipulate the Astral plane--so demon worship is completely new for Demons as well.
Before the opening of the Blood Rift, demonic society was entirely insular. Demons were born, joined the Abyss, and lived out their entire lives within its boundaries. They devoured each other and grew stronger and stronger. The most powerful demons had an innate sense of the Planescape--but they believed it to be (and some continue in this belief) the physical Heaven. Heaven is where demons are born, and Heaven is where they must return. The branching and controlling of the Abyss is a Prince's way of serving his abyssal servants: moving them closer to Heaven.
When the Blood Rift was opened, it was as if a great portal to Heaven had sprung into existence. What demon would not pursue this cause? Their final destination is filled with endless death, torture, and suffering. What's not to love? Great rulers rose to command hordes pushing into heaven, destroying and slaughtering silly devils that await them. Demons do not believe extraplanar beings to truly be *real*--they're simply heavenly objects to be used to sate the demon's eternal desires.
Demonic worship began another shift in abyssal society. The greatest demons were already god-kings of their Realms. Now, the Heavens were *reconnecting* with them in life! Beings from beyond reach out and welcome the Abyss. No longer do demons need to pass through the Heavenly Gate to find eternal ecstasy, now, if their deeds and powers traveled through the Heavens for long enough, the Heavens can reward them. Worship, to a demon, is like a gift from the Abyssal Gods--and perhaps it is. They have no love for their worshipers--they think they're conduits for their torment, and the demons often spare no time slaughtering their cults.
Demons are immortal. Over the last 2000 years, some ancient demons have found themselves worshiped across the Planescape for the first time. This is a strange phenomenon, and some Demons believe it is a path towards some future rapture--that eventually the Heavens and the Abyss will become One.
