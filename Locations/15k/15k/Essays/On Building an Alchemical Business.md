You must create the potions and sell them.
Creation:
1. grow the ingredients, acquire bottles, equipment, and labor
Sell:
1. Find buyers, transport products, sell to alchemists, merchants, or directly to people (law students, etc)
Complications:
1. Taxes on businesses and valuable shipments through Gates (can be smuggled at higher risk)
2. Drawing alchemical guild attention (pay guild dues, certain percentage of profit)
3. Drawing thieves attention (hire bodyguards)

Who to sell to:
1. The Apothecary Guild manages the crafting and sale of potions in the LFC. They sell potions directly at apothecary shops, where most potions are made in-house. If the party doesn't want to set up a shop front and instead wants to sell to other guild members, they can do so--though at a reduced value, as the apothecary will want to make a profit for their troubles. This kind of distribution is relatively common throughout the LFC, as some evening out stock is useful for the market landscape.
2. The Merchants Guild. If the party instead wants to focus their sales *outside* the LFC, they can sell to the Merchants Guild who handle import and export to the LFC.


For the night poppy potions, alchemists will want to make 25 gp--this will require them to buy the potion from the PCs for ~40 gp. (They buy for 40 and sell for 65)
The total profit can thus be increased by increasing the value of the potion without appreciably increasing its production cost.

For merchants, they could export these potions outside the city. The goods would increase in value (being a city commodity) by ~25-50% depending on some simplified supply and demand, but the merchants would want to take a 10% or more cut. Because of the addictive nature of the substance, the demand will remain high always, except in towns that deal with addiction epidemics and have crack downs.

So if the merchants value the potions at 85 gold, they think the buyers will buy it for 60 gold and sell it for at least 85. The rural apothecaries will earn 25 gp, and the merchants want a 20% profit. They'll buy the potions from the PCs for 48 gold.

How does the hauling guild play in? The Hauling Guild can handle distribution throughout the LFC (to the 2550 apothecary shops). They do so for a average rate of 2 coppers / mile per shipment. In the LFC, each city is approx 7 square miles, so perimeter to center is 3.5 miles. Then to perimeter of next city is another 3.5 miles for a total of 7 miles. Thus, a single shipment is 14 miles, or 28 copper. A guild-rate discount is 50%.
