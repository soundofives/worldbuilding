##### On an undead army
>Kalma raised an army of the undead to conquer the vast territories of the Shadaean Empire.  The undead solved some of the enduring problems of a conquering empire: the massive expense of maintaining a living military and the societal tensions of levying extreme taxes.
>Using undead as your military, however, is not without its caveats. Undead -- especially those easily raised (Shadows, Spectres, Wraiths) have an inescapable craving for the vitality of the living. They *need* to kill.
>Other undead, (skeletons, zombies, mummies) do not have this same craving, and so are more easily integrated into a longterm society.
>So...How do you support the insatiable desire to slaughter the living within your massive army? You could keep conquering, killing wider swathes of people. But this breeds more of these undead--shadows, wraiths, etc, which further increases the severity of your problem. You could...
>1. raise the army, use it, then somehow forcefully destroy it, requiring you to re-raise your next army.
>2. raise the army, use it, then sequester it. The undead would build up a raging fever of desire, making them difficult to control, but they technically would survive.
>3. allow the army to grow indefinitely. Station the shadows along the borders of society and allow them to raid outwards. As they deplete the surroundings they'll continue to push the borders of the empire further and further.
>	1. This could quickly get out of hand, provoking unwanted wars and unintentional slaughters.
>4. feed the army with livestock, prisoners of war, and the worst criminals, but not to the point of allowing the prisoners or livestock to die. Shadows feed on strength, spectres and wraiths drain hitpoint maximum. Prisons can be kept docile by allowing the army to feed on the prisoners to the point of complete weakness, but not death. This could sustain a decent working army which could be grown in times of need by Kalma or his generals as Shadow Dragons.
>Great! The last one is what happens. Military bastions keep livestock barns for feeding. Long-term prisons are relegated to the outskirts of society as well, where shadows and wraiths feed on the prisoners. This creates some discontent in society, though not too much. Small crimes are NOT punished in this way, only bad crimes.
>Society also has vampires. The vampires need flesh or blood to sustain them, and their condition is hereditary. They usually feed on livestock.

##### Undeath in society
>*"Life in the Last and First City is life spent enjoying luxury, where the fruits of all the world are available to you. It is not until after your death that you give your service to the Empire as a cog in the great machine."*

##### Social Classes in the Shadaean Empire

The social classes in the Last and First City are generally stratified by wealth and means of living.

1. **Aristocracy**
At the top of the social ladder is the ***aristocracy***. The aristocracy is made up of the wealthiest individuals in the Empire: the Guild masters, banking executives, high bureaucrats, and high clergy. These individuals and their families amassed huge amounts of wealth. The way the aristocracy has spent their wealth has changed over the many centuries of the Empire:

43rd - 49st centuries (15.8k - 15.2k): Pre-middle crisis, after the conquests of Oz-Leshah and Tanorian Empire, creation of bureaucracy and *dissolution of the old aristocracy*: 
>1. public works of religious (**Imperial**, Myriad, Cycle) significance,
>2. education (magical, **legal**)
>This rose the Incantator's Guild, the Universities, the Churches, the Bureaucracy.

Modern:
53rd - 59th century: Post-middle crisis, creation of Touchstone, economic and civic overhaul.  Main spending of the aristocracy:
>1. Bureaucratic largess and patronage,
>2. Artistic patronage
>3. Education (equally magical and legal)
>4. Entertainment, events, festivals

It is through these spending strategies that the aristocrats demonstrate their right to sit at the top of society.

The next few classes blend together more fluidly.
2. **Wealthy**
Below the wildly rich aristocracy are the ordinary upper class of wealthy individuals. This class is made up of successful merchants and high ranking guild artisans, many bureaucrats, and banking financiers and accountants, among others. The wealthy are more integrated into their communities, and their wealth goes towards similar things as the aristocracy, though at a much tamer level.

3. **Tradesmen**
Regular merchants, skilled tradesmen, and extremely successful mercenaries make up this class, the "bulk" of what everyday people might interact with and consider rich.

Below these two classes are the majority of society in the Empire. Laborers, both skilled and unskilled, who toil in the shops, mines, and industries with little pay to bring home.

4. **Skilled laborers and mercenaries**
These are the older laborers in their prime who can negotiate a much larger wage than their younger and newer counterparts. These workers have been in their positions for decades. This includes professional mercenaries, though even a few years of work will earn this class in society for a sellsword. This class also includes managerial positions on farms and the like.

5. **Unskilled laborers**
The poor, uneducated rabble. This is the largest class in the Empire. Farm laborers, miners, construction laborers, tavern workers, canal boat drivers, street sweepers, etc.

---Emperor
--Sarimah and Sarru-Zaratann
-Bureaucracy
--Banking Families
-Banks
--Guilds
-Merchants
-Artisans
-Skilled Laborers
-Unskilled Laborers
-Criminal factions
-Religious factions

-A meritocratic system (imperial examination) elects the Bureaucracy. The Bureaucracy touches all parts of society, and its members exist within a wide range of wealth classes.
-**Trade Guilds** are a large part of the power structure of the Last and First City. Guilds are the organizing institutions overseeing Artisans and Skilled Laborers. These three huge social classes make Guilds extremely influencial. Guilds are run by councils of Grand Masters, elder master craftsmen. They act as the interface and protection between most craftspeople and the Bureaucrats, specifically the Sarimah-Kasu (Coin) and his many Overseers (Naditu-Shahr) (City) and Inspectors (Shubtu-Mashtu and Shubtu-Hukra) (Law and Taxes).
While this is how it began, the various Bureaucratic positions that interface with guilds are themselves staffed by former guild lawyers or lawyers with guild patronage. Thus, Guilds themselves hold sway within the upper Bureaucracy, particularly the Qadashim Purifiers. Some of the most important Guilds:
1. Incantators (magical artisans and constructionists, grew especially around 15.1k BBT),
2. Doctors and Apothecaries,
3. Tailors,
4. Transportation and Logistics (docking and carting, grew especially around 15.1k BBT),
5. Mercenaries (grew especially around 15.3k BBT),
6. Smiths
-**Banking** rose over the last 600-800 yrs (~14.6-8k BBT) partly because of the multicultural integration (currency exchange notes being an early form of banking) of the New Tanorian Empire and Oz'Leshah. The growth of trade through the Last and First City made lending more favorable, and money changers became lenders. Eventually, successful lending families grew to become banking clans. These are hereditary groups that mostly operate within the city, though often they'll have branches in each Pale. The modern banking hierarchy generally encompasses or controls the sizeable Merchant class. The Banking Syndicates, like artisan Guilds, interface with--and even lend to--the Bureaucracy. In many ways, the Last and First City Banking Syndicates are holding companies deeply entwined with Guild, Bureaucracy, Religious, and Criminal operations. Through the lending of money and the acquisition of stocks and partial ownership, the Banks exert some level of control of most of the Last and First City society. More often than not, though, the Banking syndicates are viewed in opposition to the Guilds and the Bureaucracy (among other factions). They work to avoid the government taxes and laws to maximize profits. Their infiltrations into the Bureaucracy appear much like their Guild counterparts, though Banking connections are spread much more broadly through the entire Bureaucracy. The Reshifim Disruptor faction within the Bureaucracy have many ties to the Banking Syndicates.
Banks make most of their money from INTEREST. This is different from real-world Renaissance banks, where interest was forbade by the Church and Banks had to profit from notes of exchange. In the Last and First City, lending to other factions on speculative enterprises and collecting interest on those loans was the primary means of profit. This requires a finger on the heartbeat of the city: they must know which factions are going to succeed and which will fail. This also means the Banking Syndicates should attempt to tie themselves into the Malku Manipulator Bureaucrat faction.
Most important Banks:
1. Bank of Miros
2. The Banking Guild (headed by the Silvergleam Banking family)
Main, old, powerful bank
New banking guild movement, independent of the old powerful bank.

The Banking Guild is in stiff competition with the Mirosian Bank. The guild partners are trying to win out against the giant Bank of Miros by focusing on several things:
1. modernized banking practices and cater to a more diverse clientele.
2. The Guild banks must excel in providing specialized services not offered by the Bank of Miros, such as venture capital for burgeoning businesses, loans for technology and innovation, and modern investment strategies
3. Investing in overseas trade ventures and exploration expeditions can yield significant returns. The guild can finance ships and expeditions to discover new lands, resources, and trade routes.
4. The Guild needs to invest in building their own networks and lobbying efforts to influence policy and financial regulations in their favor.
5. Gaining the trust of clients is vital. The Guild must focus on impeccable service, transparent practices, and ethical conduct to build a reputation as trustworthy and reliable as the Bank of Miros.
6. The Guild banks can form alliances with influential businesses, guilds, and artisans to expand their reach. Collaborative ventures, such as sponsoring art exhibitions or financing expeditions, can bolster their influence.

-**Religious Factions:** the Myriad and the Cycladenes. The Myriad is a rising populist religion, while the Cycle of Twins is the traditional belief of much of the Empire (coming from the Heavenly Sinisar Empire). Religion plays a vital role in the heart of the Last and First City, connecting more to the lower classes than any other faction. Besides just appealing to the masses, the Religious Factions also deal frequently with Banks to raise money for personal armies and projects, Guilds for artisan craft support, Criminal groups for underhanded dealings, etc. The Religious factions are also constantly lobbying within the Bureaucracy to enact favorable policies to their faction or their allies. The Myriad and Cycladenes are currently approaching all-out war as a rising Myriad leadership pushes doctrine that engulfs the Cycladenes Gods into the greater pantheon of the Myraid. What power do the Churches wield? They hold an ancient, waning power base corroded by the ongoing conflicts and the Renaissance of Sashist belief. The Cycladene faith, long the most powerful Church in the Last and First City, held massive sway in the Bureaucracy (essentially appointing the Sarru-Zaratann and controlling the Lords of Law and Arcana). The Church controlled the Universities and the magical infrastructure. 

The religious war:

The Cycladene Church was immensely powerful. They were controlled by a single family that also controlled the most powerful Bank. Devout Cycladene families have family names based on important members of their heritage and the number of lives they've held, though the exact nomenclature has changed over the centuries. This bank was started long ago by Kasra, on the Spire of Miros, and is called the Bank of Miros. The administration of the Bank of Miros has secretly fallen from their orthodox Cycladene practice, and now are betraying the Cycladene Church by manipulating and instigating the takeover of the Myriad. The Bank of Miros is the main bank profiting off of the private religious war and the instability of their own familial ties. Because the Bank of Miros and the Cycladene Church are controlled by the same family, this results in intense familial civil war. Assassins, murder, intrigue, etc.

Bureaucracy + Bank were controlled by Church. Bureaucratic position weakened with rise of Sashism and Bank grew more powerful.

Decay of Cycladene Power in Arcane Matters began :
With increasing magical research and learning came a Renaissance of ancient Sashist orthodoxy, which cut into the Cycladene patronage of the Universities. This is an ongoing conflict, though generally the Universities are breaking away from their Cycladene roots.

-**Criminal Factions** span a wide range of groups. From religious fanatics like the Shynedar-Kai to loan sharks working for the Banking Syndicates. Others are the Druid Circles acting outside Sinisa and organized within New Tanore, the Thieves Guild,

##### Mercantilism and Trade

The Shadaean Empire is built around the Last and First City and its ability to control tens of megameters of surrounding territory through ease of proximity. The countryside and other, smaller, cities send goods into the City via river, cart, or horse, just as would be typical for a state of the Renaissance. There is a decent difference between the Shadaean Empire and an empire of the real world, however: there are goods made luxuries by their distance and strangeness, imported from far away lands on the Prime Material Plane. When your city seemingly sits in over thirty different climates and locations and has immediate access to all the great places of the world, then nothing is new or strange or foreign--unless you move to the next frontier, the Planescape.

In order for merchants to advance in a competitive market, they are pressured to acquire more valuable goods through riskier ventures. After the construction of Touchstone and the rise of banking and institutions that could fund expensive planar acquisitions, the first trans-planar merchants set off to bring back exotic goods from other realities.

These are ventures taken by daring individuals to map out and explore unknown paths across the Planescape, funded by aristocrats and typically involving powerful wizards, such as Leomund of the Circle of Eight.

##### Drugs and Addictive Chemicals

Much like the world before the modern period, drugs were not viewed as being "addictive" and bad. Addictive plants or substances are used primarily medicinally or recreationally, though occasionally also in minor or traditional religious cults--not the mainstream Myriad or Cycladenes. Apothecaries and alchemists are primary growers and distributors of medicinal and recreational drugs. All sorts of drugs can be found throughout the Last and First City: stimulants (nicotine and tabacco; caffeine-containing compounds such as coffee, tea, mate); inebriants (alcohol, ether); hallucinogens (mushrooms, peyote); euphoriants (cocaine; opium derivatives such as laudanum); and hypnotics.

Those living a comfortable or wealthier lifestyle might often smoke pipeweed or tabacco and drink coffee. Tea is less common. Alcohol and spirits are a common indulgence as well for working classes. Upper class peoples prefer more exotic spirits, such as several alcoholic strains from across the Planescape. Wealthier individuals also frequent smoking bars where they discuss their patronage, philosophy, arts, law, or other high-class topics.

Opium derivatives are often reserved for medicinal use, though they have found particular use in balms for the undead. Opium and its derivatives are easily absorbed through the skin, and the opium product added to the oils, balms, and tinctures often used by the bureaucratic classes has the effect of preserving dead flesh.

The more independent liberal members of society (youth, magicians, educated, some law workers) have found an increasing craze for hallucinogens and hypnotics, both mushrooms and a plant derivative from the Fey Courts called Angel's Tongue.
