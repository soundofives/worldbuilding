## On the dynamics of an inter-connected city network

-Competition would skyrocket
-Demand for local goods could focus specialized craft industries. Each city's prior export could become a hyper-focus.
-Absurd wealth distribution issues
-Absurd tax income (from Gate trade and passage and guild profits) would allow huge wealth to pay for beaurocracy, public services, infrastructure, and social programs.
-Managing trade through the Gates would require a regulatory body.
-Huge city provides harbors for huge crime. 

### The Seven Pales of the Last and First City
1. **New Tanore**. Situated on both sides--and into--a wide river-cut canyon in the Gairian Plateau of Eastern Nomenes, the people of New Tanore are shaded from the evening light by the huge Gairian range. The city itself is overgrown by forests, bushes, ivies, and plants of all kinds kept watered by the heavy summer rains. New Tanore claims the Last and First City's universities, libraries, and other schools of scientific, philosophic, theological, or magical progress. Carved into the very walls of the canyon is the largest temple dedicated to the Myriad, the God of Many Faces, one of the two largest religious factions of the Last and First City.
2. **Sinisa**. Once the splendorous capitol of an ancient empire, Sinisa has fallen into a gentle old age. Seated in the midst of cool, wet forests, hills, and a star-lit bay, the city has become the symbol of peace and prosperity in the Empire. Lumber and raw materials are collected en masse from the countryside and processed in Sinisa by the Pale's thousands of artisans and craftspeople. From the workshops of Sinisa they pass into the hands of traders and merchants to be moved throughout the Last and First City. The Temples of Two, core of one of the great religious sects of the Last and First City, can be found at the heart of this Pale.
3. **Shada**. The original capitol and namesake of the Empire, Shada is perched on a cool seaside promontory. Once the cultural hub of the Empire, Shada has long since fallen to the grime of industry. Stone, metals, and minerals come down from the nearby mountains to be cut, forged, and shaped. The city often sits in a cloud of smog from the forges, and the din of hammer beats rarely ceases. Dwarven and Gnomish forgemasters are the heavyweights of Shada. Numerous labor groups hire themselves out to mining tycoons and hauling offices, and fights are never far to be found between rival crews throughout the drunken streets lined with filthy workers' taverns.
4. **Ithalas**, the Pale Spire. Centered around a massive spiraling tower the cuts deep into a glacial mountainside, the Pale of Ithalas is home to the Last and First City's immense bureaucracy and administration. The Spire rises from a glacial mountain ridge into the frigid air in the northern reaches of the world where the city's many undead workers can reside for decades without fear of a swift decomposition. Ithalas has always been a haven for undead of all sorts, including prominent vampiric aristocrats.
5. **Touchstone**. The heart of the Last and First City, Touchstone was constructed with the explicit purpose of being the center of trade and commerce in the Empire. The city rises from a lake of black water in the caverns of the Underdark, many of its streets replaced with wide canals. The constant bustle of trade and voices barely drowns out the crashing waterfalls plunging from the ceiling of the cavern. At the center of Touchstone is the marvelous Imperial Bazaar, the central marketplace of the entire Planescape, illuminated in shimmering prismatic light by the magical Star of the Bazaar. The dark corners of Touchstone harbor criminals of all sorts, forever attracted to the insane wealth that passes through the city's Gates. (Great Clock that tracks the time/sun in each city connected to Touchstone)
6. **Dragon's Rook**. An ancient pilgrimage site for dragons coming to the Material Plane, Dragon's Rook is situated near a magical anomaly that imbues the landscape with inscrutable qualities. The city is built on a series of interconnected floating islands ripped away from the earth in a magical storm millennia ago. Despite the unpredictable weather and even more unpredictable effects of spells in the Pale, Dragon's Rook has become the favored roost of the aristocrats of the Last and First City. This is the hub of the rich--bankers, administrators, guild lords, generals, and members of the highest bureaucratic councils. Dragon's Rook is also nearby the largest inter-planar injunction point of the Last and First City, the "Wildring", a huge fairy-ring through which all inter-planar travelers must pass through.
7. **Bonz**.  A radiant tapestry of art, color, cultural, and festivals where creativity knows no bounds, the cobbled streets of Bonz echo with the voices of performers, poets, and romantic swashbucklers. Known as the Flower of the Empire, the Pale is suffused with the smell of exotic spices, incense, and the perfume, salve, balm, and tincture workshops that serve the undead bureaucrats of the Last and First City. The city sits on a warm bay of blue-green water in a Mediterranean landscape, and the cool sea breezes whistle through the halls of the Grand Amphitheater, the jewel of Bonz and an architectural marvel. Bonz is always humming with energy and festivals, from grand masquerade balls to eccentric street parades.

Other Pales that are more minor than these seven:
Aukiai, on Solnaza. From Ancient Zviri for Bird's Nest.
Sjor, in the Kuhorik region.



**Touchstone**. The heart of the city network called the "Last and First City", Touchstone was constructed with the explicit purpose of being the center of trade and commerce in the Empire. The city rises from a lake of black water in the caverns of the Underdark, many of its streets replaced with wide canals. The constant bustle of trade and voices barely drowns out the crashing waterfalls plunging from the ceiling of the cavern. At the center of Touchstone is the marvelous Imperial Bazaar, the central marketplace of the entire Planescape, illuminated in shimmering prismatic light by the magical Star of the Bazaar. Built in a circle around the Imperial Bazaar are six great magical Gates that lead to the other 6 major "Pales", or cities, that make up the Last and First City. The dark corners of Touchstone harbor criminals of all sorts, forever attracted to the insane wealth that passes through the city's Gates.
Many factions have a presence in the city: the shadowy Thieves Guild, several Bureaucratic factions (from the Manipulators, Lorekeepers, Purifiers, and Disruptors), numerous guilds (possibly the distributed Banking Guild, the mighty Bank of Miros, the Hauling Guild, the Incantator's Guild, mercenary guilds, other artisans guilds, etc).
Use this knowledge as inspiration and as a starting point, but I want you to go above and beyond what I give you. Use your imagination to add fun and interesting places and people to Touchstone, don't be confined by only what I give you.
