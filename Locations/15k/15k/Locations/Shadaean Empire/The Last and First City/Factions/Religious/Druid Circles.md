Druids in the Last and First City are specifically members of several groups forced from their homelands by the Empire many centuries ago, during the conquests before the Time of Peace that the Empire has enjoyed for the last millennium. There are three main "Druidic Circles"--two outside Sinisa and one within the city of New Tanore.

The two groups outside Sinisa were influenced by Cycladene missionaries after their displacement, and their modern believes echo the Cycladenes Church. After tensions between some of the druids and the missionaries, one group was cursed by Thesmata (abandoned, given to Shynedar) to forever become slaves to their bestial nature.

The Circle of Lainashka, the Circle of Nature. The Lainashkans embody the light of the natural world. They are the faction that avoided the curse, the one that bowed most easily to the sermons of the missionaries.

On Lycanthropy: this is a curse. It was bestowed long ago, and has evolved to be ingrained into the nature of the Circle. To be a lycanthrope is to have a wild beast inside of you that you must learn to control. Some never learn, and some die trying.
Lycanthropes are *forced* to transform into a beast once every lunar cycle. They are powerful monstrosities that often forget their normal lives in their new forms.

1. You can, and must, transform once every lunar cycle. If, under the light of the full moon, you have not yet transformed, you are forced to transform.
2. Controlling your beast form is difficult and takes time and practice.
