Druids in the Last and First City often specifically belong to one of several groups forced from their homelands by the Empire many centuries ago, during the conquests before the Time of Peace that the Empire has enjoyed for the last millennium. There are three main "Druidic Circles"--two outside Sinisa and one within the city of New Tanore.

The two groups outside Sinisa were influenced by Cycladene missionaries after their displacement, and their modern believes echo the Cycladene Church. After tensions between some of the druids and the missionaries, one group was cursed to forever become slaves to their bestial nature. The groups kept the names of their native deities: Obad-Hai and Erythnul. Both groups fight back against the expanding industry of Sinisa, the clear-cut fields of stumps and the merciless logging carts, though they go about their protests in very different ways.

The Grove of Obad-Hai. The druids of Obad-Hai embody the balance of the natural world--both the brutal pain of survival and the beauty of woodlands, rivers, and new life. These druids value their connection to nature and the protection of the natural world above all, learning to master their wild shapes and using all aspects of nature to persuade their adversaries.

Children of Erythnul, the Cursed Circle. The druids of Erythnul were cursed with lycanthropy. Many born into this curse embrace the furious beast in their heart, bringing pain and blood to their enemies. Others try to free themselves of the beast or suppress it--some even willingly bring the curse upon themselves to taste the rageful power of the creature inside them.

On Lycanthropy: this is a curse. It was bestowed long ago, and has evolved to be ingrained into the nature of the Circle. To be a lycanthrope is to have a wild beast inside of you that you must learn to control. Some never learn, and some die trying.
Lycanthropes are *forced* to transform into a beast once every lunar cycle. They are powerful monstrosities that often forget their normal lives in their new forms.

1. You can, and must, transform once every lunar cycle. If, under the light of the full moon, you have not yet transformed, you are forced to transform.
2. Controlling your beast form is difficult and takes time and practice.
