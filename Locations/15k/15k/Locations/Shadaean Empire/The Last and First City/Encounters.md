Each Pale is split into hexes, and each hex should have some landmark or location as well as an encounter.

Encounters involve some conflict between people. But who?

| Who?                         |
| ---------------------------- |
| Commoners, poor, unskilled   |
| Artisans, everyday laborer   |
| Merchants, skilled tradesmen |
| Wealthy folk                 |

| Bureaucrat                   |
| Guards                       |

The Encounter could involve any faction:
