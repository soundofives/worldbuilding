Shadows roam the halls, satiated. They feed on an imprisoned (demon?) in the basement of the Night Forest. The demon is either important to the research of some professor or important to the motor function of the Tower.

### What is the Tower?
The Wandering Tower is the home and creation of Zagyg. The Tower serves as the home base for Zagyg and the people he gathered around himself. Early in his time, Zagyg himself would teach apprentices and young magical scholars, however this task has since been given to other accomplished mages. Magical study during this time of the Last and First City is focused around the idea that the magic of the ancient world held significant power. Embracing history and the ideals of the ancient world is key to understanding the magic they possessed. This is the Renaissance, after all!
- A Renaissance mindset! The allure of Old Tanore. The mysticism of the Red Sun and the Decimation. The purity of the *civilization* held in the past. These are the ideas gripping the scholarly and the rich. Aristocrats debate in parlors about history. They read books and jest about the merits of the authors' arguments. They reach ancient poetry. To be educated (and to support education and the arts) is to be *aristocratic*, romantic*, **influencial**!
- Ancient magic holds incredible power! This idea comes from the myths and legends that surround the ancient world of Tanore and the periods before it.
These societal ideals lead to magical study focused around lost knowledge. Ancient languages and grammar is taught and used in spells. Ancient ruins are sought after for the possibility of hidden knowledge, riches, and power. In Zagyg's tower, the students are taught to learn from those that experienced history: the dead. Many of the more advanced scholars of the Tower are never without their spiritual companion, a ghostly specter who lived in a time long past. The specters help the students study, learn, and give them knowledge from the time that they lived. These specters can only be summoned using some relic fragment of their life, and collecting this relic from long-lost ruins is a quintessential milestone in all of Zagyg's students' careers. Zagyg's own spiritual advisor, Taforayesh, plays an important role in the administration of the Tower, acting as the administrative Wizardhead while he is away.

Of course, this pursuit and refinement of lost knowledge, artifacts, and magic is impossible for the squishy sorcerers alone. This is where the second half of the Tower's denizens come in: the Tower Crew mercenaries. The Tower Crew is a branch of a larger mercenary company that has long been contracted to Zagyg. The company keeps a steady supply of mercenaries sent to live at the Tower. There they work, essentially, for Zagyg himself. Members of the Crew might help collect rare or dangerous spell components--mercury distilled from the dust of the Desolation, a diamond that's passed through the stomach of a wurm, etc--or carry out other jobs for the Mad Mage. Zagyg is not just a wizard, and the Tower requires more than just spell components to run. Zagys is a prominent player in the political games of the City, and Crewmembers might help slander an opponent or help prepare a festival to woo big-money lenders. Tower apprentices have to pay tuition--and if they don't, Crewmembers might be brought into rectify the situation.

**1. The Whispering Shadows**

Throughout the tower, there are occasional sightings of shadowy figures that move silently and speak in hushed, cryptic whispers. These shadowy entities are rumored to be ancient spirits or manifestations of the tower's magic itself.

The PCs may find clues about their nature by investigating old tomes or seeking out hidden messages in the shadows.

**2. The Sealed Chamber**

Deep within the tower, there is a chamber sealed with powerful enchantments and guarded by golems of stone and steel. No one knows what lies within, but the Witch has warned that it must never be opened. The chamber's purpose and the reason behind its sealing remain a tantalizing mystery, driving the PCs to uncover its secrets.

**3. The Lost Archmage's Spellbook**

Rumors persist of a lost archmage's spellbook, said to contain forbidden spells and ancient incantations of immense power.

Occasionally, a hauntingly beautiful melody fills the air within the tower. No source can be found for this music, and those who follow the sound find themselves led deeper into the tower, where strange and otherworldly sights await. The origin of this spectral orchestra and its connection to the tower's magical mysteries is an enigma that beckons exploration.

**7. The Elemental Gateway**

Rumors persist of a hidden chamber that serves as a portal to the Elemental Planes. It is said that the Witch herself used it in her youth to explore the elemental realms. Finding the key to this gateway could allow the PCs to venture into these planes, but unlocking its secrets might require solving complex riddles and overcoming elemental guardians.

**8. The Shifting Staircase**

Within the tower, there's a staircase that seems to change its destination randomly. Those who ascend it may find themselves in different parts of the tower with each use.
