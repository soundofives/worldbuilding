### What is the Tower?
The Wandering Tower is the home and creation of Zagyg. The Tower serves as the home base for Zagyg and the people he gathered around himself. Early in his time, Zagyg himself would teach apprentices and young magical scholars, however this task has since been given to other accomplished mages. Magical study during this time of the Last and First City is focused around the idea that the magic of the ancient world held significant power. Embracing history and the ideals of the ancient world is key to understanding the magic they possessed. This is the Renaissance, after all!
- A Renaissance mindset! The allure of Old Tanore. The mysticism of the Red Sun and the Decimation. The purity of the *civilization* held in the past. These are the ideas gripping the scholarly and the rich. Aristocrats debate in parlors about history. They read books and jest about the merits of the authors' arguments. They reach ancient poetry. To be educated (and to support education and the arts) is to be *aristocratic*, romantic*, **influencial**!
- Ancient magic holds incredible power! This idea comes from the myths and legends that surround the ancient world of Tanore and the periods before it.
These societal ideals lead to magical study focused around lost knowledge. Ancient languages and grammar is taught and used in spells. Ancient ruins are sought after for the possibility of hidden knowledge, riches, and power. In Zagyg's tower, the students are taught to learn from those that experienced history: the dead. Many of the more advanced scholars of the Tower are never without their spiritual companion, a ghostly specter who lived in a time long past. The specters help the students study, learn, and give them knowledge from the time that they lived. These specters can only be summoned using some relic fragment of their life, and collecting this relic from long-lost ruins is a quintessential milestone in all of Zagyg's students' careers. Zagyg's own spiritual advisor, Taforayesh, plays an important role in the administration of the Tower, acting as the administrative Wizardhead while he is away.

Of course, this pursuit and refinement of lost knowledge, artifacts, and magic is impossible for the squishy sorcerers alone. This is where the second half of the Tower's denizens come in: the Tower Crew mercenaries. The Tower Crew is a branch of a larger mercenary company that has long been contracted to Zagyg. The company keeps a steady supply of mercenaries sent to live at the Tower. There they work, essentially, for Zagyg himself. Members of the Crew might help collect rare or dangerous spell components--mercury distilled from the dust of the Desolation, a diamond that's passed through the stomach of a wurm, etc--or carry out other jobs for the Mad Mage. Zagyg is not just a wizard, and the Tower requires more than just spell components to run. Zagys is a prominent player in the political games of the City, and Crewmembers might help slander an opponent or help prepare a festival to woo big-money lenders. Tower apprentices have to pay tuition--and if they don't, Crewmembers might be brought into rectify the situation.

### Summary of the Complex
#### Sub Floors

1. **Chapel to the Two** An ornate temple covered in mosaic art.
2. **Crypt** The entrance to the Tower Crypts. Beneath the tower lies a labyrinthine network of catacombs. These catacombs are said to contain ancient relics, forgotten spells, and the resting places of powerful warlocks and mercenaries. Navigating these treacherous tunnels, filled with undead guardians and forgotten horrors, could uncover long-buried secrets about the tower's history.
	1. **Blocked Wing** One wing of the expansive catacombs seems to be purposefully blocked.
#### Lower Levels

##### Ground floor
1. **[[The Atrium]]** Upon entering the tower, you'll find yourself in the Atrium, a large, luminous chamber with a soaring ceiling. The walls are adorned with tapestries that depict a history of magic, and a massive magical chandelier illuminates the room. Here, people gather for assignments and pass into and out of the Tower.
2. **Mess** Attached to the Atrium is the spacious messhall. The mess is spaced with wooden tables of various shapes set around the room, and an old spell that went awry caused many of the tables and chairs to float aimlessly around the room. They can be pulled down and used, but will sometimes float back up, even when sat upon. No one has been able to remove the enchantment: the chairs don't seem to like the attempts.
3. **Kitchen** The Kitchen is set apart from the tower to prevent fire mishaps, which seem to happen on a weekly basis, from destroying the whole Tower. The Kitchen is run by Grumblebelly, a tiny goblin that never seems to gain weight, no matter how much he eats...and he's always hungry.
4. **Gardens** Next to the Kitchen sits a gorgeous garden area. The Gardens serve several purposes: growing food for the Kitchens, acting as an outdoor common space for the Tower's denizens, and harboring numerous species of rare magical plants for study and horticulture. The back part of the gardens, towards the edge of the Tower island, is wooded.
	1. One path in the gardens, the **Garden Statuary**, is set with partially animated statues that often provide banter, riddles, or advise to passers-by.
	2. One corner of the wooded part of the Gardens is a place seemingly of eternal darkness, called the **Night Gardens**. The Night Gardens are difficult to get to and navigate--they are shrouded by layers of illusion and enchanted brambles. The Night Gardens seem to be connected to the Tower Shades, as they gather in the gardens frequently.
5. **Chapel to the Myriad** An expansive chapel area dedicated to the many deities of the Myriad.
##### Floors 2-5

1. **The Library** The Tower's repository of ancient mystical knowledge. The Library is multi-storied, with ladders, stairs, or trees leading from one story or platform to the next. The Library is filled with shelves upon shelves of arcane tomes, scrolls, manuscripts, and tablets. Much of the library is unorganized, as the books like to rearrange themselves when no one is looking. Some sections of the library are blocked off or restricted, guarded by enchantments or whispering spirits.
	1. Hidden away in a restricted corner of the Library is a section filled with books and scrolls that contain knowledge of events that have not yet occurred. Some scholars have been driven mad attempting to decipher the cryptic writings, but rumors say that those who can make sense of them might gain the power to alter fate itself.

##### Floors 6-8

1. **Staff Quarters** Housing chambers and towers for the main Tower staff: custodial crew, kitchen workers and cooks, librarians, gardeners and groundskeepers, etc.
#### Mid Levels
##### Floor 9
1. **The Wizard's Knobbly Knob**  A tavern and popular gathering space, the Wizard's Knob features a bar, balcony, music stage, and more. A wooden raven insults all who enter.
2. **Training Area** Several beat-up rooms attached to an expansive enchanted balcony, the Training Area is a safe space for students to practice spells or martial skills. Training dummies and obstacles are scattered through the area, alongside remnants of thousands of spells. This area is used by both the Tower's students and the members of the Crew.
3. **Lower Mercenary Chambers** Several rooms and towers dedicated to housing the Crew.

##### Floors 10 - 13

1. **Middle Mercenary Chambers** More rooms and towers dedicated to housing the Crew. The living quarters for mercenaries are well-organized but comfortable. Each member has their own private room, decorated according to their tastes. A communal area is equipped with a hearth for socializing, and a training ground for combat practice lies just outside.
2. **Apprentice Rooms** Several rooms and towers dedicated to housing younger apprentices.
3. **The Lounge** Situated on the 8th Floor, the Lounge is a warm sitting space for people to gather at any time of day or night.

##### Floors 14 and 15

1. **Ballroom** A spacious, multi-storied ballroom for event hosting and choir recitals. These floors hold a small kitchen area, a balcony, and several side halls to get away from the noise.
2. **Statuary Corridor** Lifelike statues of long-forgotten adventurers and mages stand in this room, each possessing a unique ability or curse. Interacting with these statues can lead to puzzles and mysterious insights.
3. **Portrait Gallery** In a dimly lit corridor, there's a gallery of portraits that seem to shift and change when no one is looking. Some say the portraits are cursed, and those who study them too closely risk becoming trapped within the frames. Exploring the origins of these paintings and their connection to the tower's history may reveal a sinister secret.

##### Floors 16-18

1. **Studies** Private study rooms and miniature libraries for students to pore over their books.
2. **Accounting suite** This small set of antechambers serves as the personal living suite and business area of the Tower's personal banker.
	1. **Storage Room** The main storage room for things brought back from adventures. Items are generally categorized before being moved to their appropriate place in the Tower.
	2. **Safe** A heavily-guarded safe for the more valuable finds.

#### Upper Floors

##### Floors 19 and 20

1. **The Lecture Hall** A large, cluttered room where all the main lectures take place. Much of the room is set with several desks and seats for pupils, and a wide lecturing stage is set at the front. The walls are lined with shelves of spell components, alchemical ingredients, tomes, or other instructional materials. Corners of the lecture hall are raised and provide additional storage space.
2. **Enchantment Chamber** A series of side chambers dedicated to the task of enchanting and inscribing magic onto scrolls and tomes.
##### Floor 21

1. **Orrery of the Unravelling** A room suffused with elemental power, the Orrery is centered around a mystical complex brass machine. The machine spins and whirls, allowing observers to conjure bits of the Unravelling, the elemental energy that fills the space between the Planes. This is a chamber dedicated to planar study and scholarship.

##### Floor 22

1. **Necromantic laboratory** A gruesome lab filled with skeletons of all sorts of species and tanks of magical liquid preserving vile creations. The Necromantic Laboratory serves as a place to study the mechanisms of life and death.

##### Floors 23 - 30

1. **Mage Quarters** Towers and chambers for the professors. Most chambers are multi-roomed, allowing for family living and a personal study.
2. **Divinatory** A large extension off the side of the Tower, the Divinatory is dedicated to astronomical and astrological study and divination.

#### The Pinnacle of the Tower

1. **Zagyg's Chamber** This opulent, chaotic, and messy room serves as Zagyg's private workspace. It's adorned with shelves of ancient tomes, mystical artifacts, and an expansive, ornate desk where the Warlock conducts his business. A large, ornamental cauldron bubbles in one corner, and a towering bookshelf holds the most valuable magical volumes. The walls are lined with portraits of bewildering creatures and past students.
2. **Chapel to Sashas** A high, austere chapel dedicated to the Far Away Lady.
