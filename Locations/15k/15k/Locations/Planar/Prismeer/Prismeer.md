 Prismeer is the Fey Court ruled by Tasha and home to her magical school. Tasha has fallen out with the other archmages of the Last and First City--particularly Zagyg. She continues to work with the Circle of Eight on occasion, but is generally solitary. She hid away in Prismeer after escaping Graz'zt's dungeons in the Abyss, hoping that she could evade her many enemies there.
