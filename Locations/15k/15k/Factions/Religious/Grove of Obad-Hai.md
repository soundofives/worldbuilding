Druids in the Last and First City often specifically belong to one of several groups forced from their homelands by the Empire many centuries ago, during the conquests before the Time of Peace that the Empire has enjoyed for the last millennium. There are three main "Druidic Circles"--two outside Sinisa and one within the city of New Tanore.

The two groups outside Sinisa were influenced by Cycladene missionaries after their displacement, and their modern believes echo the Cycladene Church. After tensions between some of the druids and the missionaries, one group was cursed to forever become slaves to their bestial nature. The groups kept the names of their native deities: Obad-Hai and Erythnul. Both groups fight back against the expanding industry of Sinisa, the clear-cut fields of stumps and the merciless logging carts, though they go about their protests in very different ways.

The Grove of Obad-Hai. The druids of Obad-Hai embody the balance of the natural world--both the brutal pain of survival and the beauty of woodlands, rivers, and new life. These druids value their connection to nature and the protection of the natural world above all, learning to master their wild shapes and using all aspects of nature to persuade their adversaries.

Boons of ascending in the Grove:

*At major levels of renown within a faction, (3,9,20,28,48), you gain boons.*

Renown 3: You can spend ten days of downtime assisting with the Grove's goals. To the druids of Obad-Hai, this act (in addition to counting towards days of Gaining Renown) is sacred. If you can do this for at leastÂ **ten days**, you'll be rewarded with **inspiration**. So when the adventure does start, you'll have a leg up on whatever trouble you'll be facing that day. You can only have 1 point of inspiration stored this way at a time.

Renown 9: You are inducted into the Grove. You can choose a role:
Evangelist (bioterrorist)
Votary (sacred rites acolyte)
Saggitar (grove protector)

In addition, your connection to the Grove grants you the ability to hone your wild shape abilities. You can learn to channel the more exotic forms that nature takes: monstrosities, plants, oozes, and fey. By conducting a long and complex ritual over a lunar span (new moon to full moon), you can learn a new exotic form. 

Renown 20: You are a loyal, respected member of the Grove. You've proved yourself in your prior role, and are allowed to undertake a new ritual. (Requirement: Druid level 10). You can use two charges of your wildshape ability to increase the maximum CR of your form by 1.

Renown 28: You have become a master in the Grove. As a master, your meditations have allowed you to perfect your connection with nature: you can choose to learn celestial or draconic forms during your lunar rituals.

Renown 48: Holding the highest position of respect and power in the Grove, you can now increase your maximum wildshape CR by 2 when using both charges.
