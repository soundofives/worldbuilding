The Cycle of Twins is an ancient and dualistic religion deeply ingrained in the history and culture of the empire. It revolves around the worship of two gods, Thesmata and Shynedar, who represent contrasting concepts. The religion's adherents, known as Cycladenes, adhere to the belief that everything in the world is intrinsically connected to the balance of these dualities. Here's an overview of the Cycle of Twins:

**Core Beliefs**:

1. **Thesmata and Shynedar**: Thesmata is the god associated with positive and desirable aspects of life, such as light, wisdom, prosperity, and benevolence. Shynedar, in contrast, represents negative elements like darkness, chaos, misfortune, and malevolence.
    
2. **Duality**: The central tenet of the Cycle of Twins is the interplay of dualities. Cycladenes believe that everything in the world is a manifestation of this balance, and both Thesmata and Shynedar are essential for the world's equilibrium.
    
3. **Worship in Pairs**: Cycladenes practice their faith by paying tribute to both gods, often in pairs. They believe that harmonizing both deities in their rituals ensures that life remains in balance.
