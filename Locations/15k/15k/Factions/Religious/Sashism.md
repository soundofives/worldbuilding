The worshipers of the deity Sashas are a small and unique group in the Last and First City, usually found within practitioners of magic and the arcane. The Sashists are not organized under a central Church: they are a growing movement, spreading through a Renaissance of ancient magical knowledge uncovered in universities and other learned institutions. To the Sashists, Sashas is the only **good** deity. All others are false, perverted, malicious, or evil.
