of Hextor and Heironeous

Headed by Murlynd, a former member of the Company of Seven and a friend of Zagyg.

Founded under the names of the deity brothers Hextor and Heironeous, the Brothers' Company is a prominent mercenary group in the Last and First City. While the company's primary motivations are pragmatic and secular, they maintain a veneer of respect for the values associated with the Brothers. In the myth of the Myriad, the Brothers are arch enemies, constantly fighting to best each other. The Company pushes ideals of competition and strength, fostering an environment where members compete and challenge each other, believing that competition breeds strength. However, they also understand that unity is essential for success, and every member stands together during contracts. They hold justice, and honor through that justice, in high regard. In the eyes of the Brotherhood, justice is given through the mercenary contract, and justice should never be given freely.

**Operational Structure**:

The Brothers' Company is divided into "Orders," each specializing in different aspects of mercenary work. These orders reflect the duality of Hextor and Heironeous:

1. **Order of the Lion (Heironeous)**: This order is responsible for upholding justice and righteousness. They take on contracts that involve protecting the innocent and fighting against corruption.
    
2. **Order of the Serpent (Hextor)**: The Order of the Serpent is more pragmatic and specializes in battle tactics and strategy. They are often hired for war campaigns and battles where strength and aggression are crucial.
    
3. **Order of the Scales (Balance)**: This order seeks to maintain the balance between Hextor's competitive nature and Heironeous' chivalrous ideals. They handle contracts that require both strength and honor.
