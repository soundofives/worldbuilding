The Apothecaries Guild organizes and regulates the herbo-magical potion crafters and sellers in the Last and First City. There are around 2500 guild members throughout the City, organized into 50 Halls headed by guild masters that represent their area in a Great Hall located in New Tanore.
Guild membership grants:
1. the ability to sell potions within the City
2. access to guild Halls and contacts
3. a voice in the guild administration
4. social security
5. health support
6. protection if needed
7. limited valuable item insurance (50% of the value of the goods is insured, )

Number of AG members:
Doctors / Apothecaries: SV 1700
Magic Shops / Alchemists: SV 2800
Total: 2550, separated into 50 Halls of 50 members spread throughout the 7 Pales.
Each Hall is headed by a guild master that represents that Hall in the Great Hall located in New Tanore.

Guild dues breakdown:
For renting guild halls:
Assuming an aristocratic Great Hall, 30 Wealthy Halls, and 20 Comfortable Halls, this comes out to 12 gold per year, or 1 gold per month dues.
(4x365 + 2x365x30 + 0.8x365x20)/2550 = 12
If each Hall has an accountant, thats 50 accountants being payed ~60 gp / month as educated workers. 50x60 = 3000.
Funerals and financial stability of widows and families of journeymen and masters is a significant cost. Because each alchemist and apothecary enjoys different profits from the next, the large dues associated with this cannot be spread evenly. Each member is expected to pay into this fund 10% of their annual profits.
Rollover from this flat rate goes towards helping members pay for healing services, hospitals, etc.
Further rollover from this flat rate goes towards hiring of mercenaries and guards if protection is needed.
Insurance policy for valuable goods protection through the Bank of Miros. The policy covers 2 million gold in possible damages each year (which would never really happen), and charges the guild 20000 gold per year. Among all the members, this is basically an additional 8 gold per year.
So, in total, this is basically 10% annual profit + 20 gp.

Also--Guilds serve to keep markets and monopolies in check. No one apothecary should rise above the others--generally, this means that there is a *minimum* price set on goods and a *maximum* amount of potions are allowed on the market to ensure stable prices. Essentially, there is a *maximum* market share allowed for each apothecary. When new apothecaries are opened in the LFC, this maximum market share decreases as the total market is distributed among a larger number of apothecaries. They essentially want to minimize competition and keep prices high by ensuring any market is not flooded.
What is this maximum? If there are 2550 apothecaries, and each survives on ~60 gp / month, then about 153,000 gp worth of potions, salves, tinctures are sold every month.
3 million people: 1% aristocrats and 5% are wealthy. This is the market for luxury potions.
If aristocrats spend 10% of their spending money on healthcare (doctors, potions, spells), that's 270,000 gp. Let's say 10% of that goes to potions. 27,000 gp.
Same for the wealthy class, which comes to 54,000 gp spent on potions. Total market for luxury potions: 81,000 gp / month. The most common luxury potions are health potions (50 gp) and elixirs of health (100-130 gp). Thus the average is around 80 gp. About 1000 luxury potions are sold every month. If supply swings 20% in either direction, the Guild **must** act--and that's a cap. Even a 10% increase in luxury potions sales will prompt a Guild response--they'll force 

If luxury potions make up 50% of apothecary revenue, actual revenue for apothecaries is 465 gp /month. Something's up...


--even 100 potions every month would draw Guild regulations.

 A business specializing in luxury potions could quickly saturate the market.
