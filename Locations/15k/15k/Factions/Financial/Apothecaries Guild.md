2. access to guild Halls and contacts
3. a voice in the guild administration
4. social security
5. health support
6. protection if needed
7. limited valuable item insurance (50% of the value of the goods is insured, )




Number of AG members:
Doctors / Apothecaries: SV 1700
Magic Shops / Alchemists: SV 2800
Total: 2550, separated into 50 Halls of 50 members spread throughout the 7 Pales.
Each Hall is headed by a guild master that represents that Hall in the Great Hall located in New Tanore.

Guild dues breakdown:
For renting guild halls:
Assuming an aristocratic Great Hall, 30 Wealthy Halls, and 20 Comfortable Halls, this comes out to 12 gold per year, or 1 gold per month dues.
(4x365 + 2x365x30 + 0.8x365x20)/2550 = 12
If each Hall has an accountant, thats 50 accountants being payed ~60 gp / month as educated workers. 50x60 = 3000.
Funerals and financial stability of widows and families of journeymen and masters is a significant cost. Because each alchemist and apothecary enjoys different profits from the next, the large dues associated with this cannot be spread evenly. Each member is expected to pay into this fund 10% of their annual profits.
Rollover from this flat rate goes towards helping members pay for healing services, hospitals, etc.
Further rollover from this flat rate goes towards hiring of mercenaries and guards if protection is needed.
Insurance policy for valuable goods protection through the Banking Guild. The policy covers 2 million gold in possible damages each year (which would never really happen), and charges the guild 20000 gold per year. Among all the members, this is basically an additional 8 gold per year.
So, in total, this is basically 10% annual profit + 20 gp.
