Maximo has 12 renown with Adnan

**Levels of Renown**
Renown is a measure of your influence, rank, fame, or otherwise standing within *or to* a group, faction, or person. There are two main ways to use renown: **within** an organization or **outside** of it.

*Renown outside an organization*
Renown can be built between a character and a faction even without hard ties or membership. In this capacity, characters don't gain all the benefits of faction membership (authority, magic abilities, secret knowledge, etc) but do gain **contacts** and **trust**. The faction can still be called on in times of need, but the character won't be able to summon their full forces at a whim.

*Renown within an organization*
Being within an organization grants more benefits to those with renown and control, but it often implies more dedication and can require hard tests, steps, trials, or accomplishments. Being "within" an organization doesn't necessarily mean rising through its core structure--a character can create or be placed in custom roles or positions that scale with their renown. Using renown in this way can often gain a character **authority**, **special abilities, secret knowledge, access to restricted locations**, **trust, contacts and** **patronage**.

| Ranking       |              | Renown Points | Average time (human) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| *Outside Guild* | *Inside Guild* |               |                      |
| hostile       |              | -6            | 1 year               |
| distrusting    |              | -3            | 3 months             |
| ambivalent    |              | 0             | 0                    |
| friendly       |              | 2             | 2 months             |
| trusting              | initiate     | 3             | 3 months             |
| allied      | apprentice   | 9             | 1 year               |
| loyal              | journeyman   | 20            | 5 years              |
| devoted              | master       | 28            | 10 years             |
|               | high master  | 48            | 30 years             |

At major levels of renown within a faction, (3,9,20,28,48), you gain boons.


**Patronage**
The cycle of support, largess, and patronage in universal through many of the Factions in the Last and First City. The wealthy members of society are pressured to identify and auspice rising members, and the success of their protege is a large factor in their social credibility. Patronage is not just a financial transaction; it often involves providing opportunities, connections, and resources to help the protege develop their skills and talents. The exact amount of money offered to the protege would depend on the patron's wealth, generosity, and the specific needs of the protege. Further, patronage is not a one-way affair. The auspice of a patron might come with expectations of provided services (artwork, artisan works, jobs or duties, tutelage), shared income (company shares or a cut of a business's future profits), dedication and loyalty, a positive public image, promotion and networking on the patron's behalf, etc.
*Wealthy* members of society tend to be most willing to provide patronage, though they cannot offer the full bounty of the *aristocrats*.
The wealth of all guilds is not equal. Additionally, one family might be the patrons of more than one protege.

**Gaining Patronage**
Gaining patronage is no easy feat--this is a complex social dance that takes time and skill.
As part of your downtime, you can specifically **search for a patron**.
Searching for and engaging with a possible patron is a combination of **Networking** and a **Skill Challenge**.
**Networking**, or actually finding potential patrons in the first place, takes at least 10 days of downtime and costs **50**, or **250 gp**Â depending on if you are searching in the *wealthy* or *aristocratic* classes of society. If you want to spend time with the *aristocratic* class, you'll either need access to the local nobility or be disguised with one. During the week you mingle, party, and socialize with members of that social class and faction. *These costs, and the time, can be lessened if you have prior **contacts** that can help introduce you*.

After you meet a potential patron, you can attempt to impress them and lock down your patronage. This is a **Skill Challenge** where the specific skills used will depend on who you are talking to. A banker might be impressed with social tact or financial intuition. A grizzled mercenary captain might be impressed with martial aptitude, toughness, or leadership skills. A prestigious thief might be impressed by your ability to infiltrate a locked guild vault.

In any case, the ability to woo a patron and get the maximum amount of patronage depends on your **renown** with the faction and your personal **renown** with the patron. Oftentimes you might want to delay the full **Skill Challenge** to lock in your patronage until after you've found someone open to the idea and spent time with them to gain their trust, though if you're confident enough in your ability to woo them in the **Skill Challenge**, then that could gain you some initial renown to build off of if you excel.

Once you have a patron, you can increase your monetary patronage over time by further building renown.
