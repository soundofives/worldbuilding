Thoughts and notes:
- Pagan Fey myth vs Universal Church, Reconquista/Crusades into Pagan Lands (internal Devil struggles or Pagan vs Christian)
- Celtic + Viking barbarian factions (Chaos) lie outside warring Christian powers (Law), middle lands ruled by Marcher Kings
- Options:
        - full Reconquista, where two "civilized" factions war over territory and religion. In this scheme, it would follow that Islamic Moorish southerners invaded Bront, forcing out the elves who claim the Shadaean Empire as their legacy. The Christian Elves work to reconquer Bront from the north and east.
            - How do the pagans fit in here?
        - Reconquista inspired, where one "civilized" faction works to conquer the uncivilized (almost Roman-esque...)

History:
    - The LFC collapses around Bonz. Moorish lords invade from the subcontinent south of Luazil, pushing the elven aristocracy north.
        OR
    - The LFC collapses around Bonz. After a period of catastrophe, barbarians move in and claim rule, filling the countryside with outlandish pagans. After a time, Christian northeasterners move in and claim the legacy of the Shadaean Empire. Moorish southerners are entreated to counterinvade to stop the Christian elves, though in time the Moorish invasion leaves this pretense behind as it grabs land, riches, and power.

    BEFORE THE COLLAPSE
    - 25-23k: The region of the lakes in western Luazil (and the southern coast there), Kuhorik, sees the growth of minor elven kingdoms 
    - 23-21.5k: The minor kingdoms of Kuhorik grow into classical powers
    - 21.5k: The Plane Race concludes. What actually happens here? "Gate magic is developed" -- does it happen catastrophically?
        - The first wizard to create a Gate spell discovers, in a sense, a means to travel to planar regions that they already theorized existed. Kind of like the development of a caravel to sail across the Atlantic -- they had theories of what they'd find, but they didn't have the tools to explore. Now they do. Casting Gate, the wizards of Asfalon are first able to access Vanemer's Astral Sea.

    THE COLLAPSE
    - The collapse of the LFC would constitute total societal collapse. A true catastrophe on the largest scale -- everything would fragment, fracture, and burn. The Empire extended into the Lakes region, but the northern mountains were never brought under its control. There lived "barbarians". When the Gates shut down, cities and towns were isolated and left to the whims of local rulers -- many of whom were incompetent. The Emperor's shadow army was left without a ruler, and their betrayal leads to the first catastrophe of the age. Shadows swoop in, slaughtering anyone they can find and drastically reducing the population. BG3's "Shadow Curse" falls across the land, and the divine continuance collapses, leading to a widespread climatic disaster. Famine and pestilence further plague the collapsed Empire. Without the shadows to keep them at bay and a rabid climate nipping at their heels, barbarians invade. A dark-ages world follows, and much knowledge is lost. Many of the shadows are defeated by heroes as faith takes on increasingly radiant traits -- in one respect, the church was the only translocal governance left. Kept at bay by heroic divine magic, the remaining shadows sink into a sort of hibernation. The undead still curse some lands.
    - The lands around the Empmire contain many cultures and peoples. Those that initially move in are going to have interacted with the Empire for thousands of years -- much like the germanic tribes that first invade the Roman Empire, they have many of the same traits. Others, such as those to the north, are more foreign. The mixing of these cultures creates the wild pagan landscape around Bonz after the subsidence of the shadow curse.
    - The demographic collapse leads initially to a big-man system of government with institutional slavery. As the collapse continued, the further catastrophes led to the rise of fuedalism and manorialism with rulers beholden to an overhead Church. The political landscape:
        - Around former Bonz, former Germano-barbarians form small, loose magic-sympathizing Christian feudal kingdoms surrounded by clans and wildlands.
        - In the mountains of the east, magic-suspicious Christian elves organize into strict manorial kingdoms under a central Papal Church.
        - To the north, the barbarians continue to rule. Viking-like pagans raid southward.
        - To the south, multiethnic heathens of the subcontinent form a magocratic caliphate.
    - The eastern Christian Elves grow warmongering, and in their religious fervor they rally around the idea of their lost empire to which they bear ownership. They invade the lands around Bonz, getting some help from local Christian warlords while others joined their pagan countrymen. The defenders call upon the southern heathens for aid, and they answer with sweeping armies to battle the Christians.

Elements:
- Many kingdoms, some large, some small, with varying levels of control - each headed by some fantastic personality
- Heavy religious themes as driving factors behind many conflicts
- A countryside filled with castles of Chivalric Orders, bands of Merry Men, mysterious wizards towers, mystic groves, witches, and monsters
- Creatures of Celtic, Breton, Welsh, and Scottish myth: fairies, river spirits, giants, dragons, shapeshifters, etc.
- A complex magico-cultural landscape. Three realms of magic: Arcane, Divine, Nature. The land is bereft and distrusting of arcane magic, with wizards spoken of in hushed and fearful tones. Wizards are rare, and they often sequester themselves in hidden and isolated towers, keeping their magic secret and encrypted -- always fearful of other wizards seeking them out. Divine and Nature magics are much more common --
