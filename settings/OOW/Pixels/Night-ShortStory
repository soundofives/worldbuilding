Sergio Yontez leaned against the cold metal bar and looked up at the projection in front of him. He took a sip of his whiskey and smiled. He could see it now: the new couch in his apartment, a fancy dinner out with Ellie, or maybe he'd save it for a new grav bike. Ha! What did it matter? He was going home sixty-two bits heavier, and he was loving every second of the game in front of him.

It was going so smoothly: dev1ce was riding clean at 15 hits and he'd only taken one so far. His eyes flashed back and forth following the avatar in the projection.

Dev1ce was a huge player, half-orc with more brawns than three regular men put together. He was dodging shots left and right and playing to his regular beat. Careful shot. Duck and cover. Roll down and flip to the wall. Shoot while the gonk in front of him was looking down. Sergio had watched him play before, and tonight he was on the top of his game.

Dev1ce flatlined another player. It was just him and BenL0v now. Perfect. BenL0v was a good player, sure, but his forte was in TDM, not here. It was basically settled--Sergio's bet would pull big. He closed his eyes and smelled the victory.

When he opened them, he coughed up his whiskey. Dev1ce had just taken eight hits. Nine. Ten. No. No. NO.

Night logged off and spun in her desk chair, laughing. Dev1ce was easy. It only took a few games to understand him, and a few more to be better at being him than he was. He gets confident, and thats when he slips up. He would make it to the final two, then get pummeled by someone smarter than him. That's why Night played around BenL0v. He's a shit player, honestly, but he's smarter than dev1ce. Night had taken out any other gonk gunning for BenL0v during the game so that he'd be left to face dev1ce in the final showdown. Throw in a few overconfident spits, a specific twitch in his left pointer finger, a special brutality only found in killers and voila, a perfectly fixed House.

Suckers.
