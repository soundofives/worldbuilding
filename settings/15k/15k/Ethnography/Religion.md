### Religion in the shadow of the Red Sun

Sagobad faith rises from the Red Sun. A combination of Thandairian sevakath sacrificialism and Hemangh aspectism. Hemanghism loses its Gates during the Red Sun, thus losing its centralization. Diasporic Hemanghism loses connectivity, with individual city cult groups branching off.

Facets of Hemanghism:
1. Scholar priests, seeking to know the unknowable. Aristocrats organized in secretive cabals
2. Close, personal relationship with Hemangh
3. Hemangh is esoteric, exotic, and fundamentally unknowable
Facets of Shaasakid faith:
1. Afterlife focused, mediated by a priest via sacrificial ritual
2. Astaire clergy, non-aristocratic
3. Entirely polytheistic
Facets of the Cult of Isakash
1. Offers magic
2. Close, personal relationship with Isakash
3. Complex, scholarly rituals that focus on protection + gestalt monastic teamwork
4. Other gods are evil and must be distanced

Pressures during Red Sun:
1. Failing climate leading to mass crop failure, famine, disease
2. Mass population loss
3. Mass migrations

**Hemanghism**
The scholar-priests of Hemanghism fell through, as without the Gates their skills and knowledge were completely useless. Hemanghism had to wildly adapt away from their homeland.
Migratory Hemanghist people carried only layknowledge, occasionally accompanied by priests. General understanding of the theology is the limit: one god connecting all things. The name and nature of the god varies with each group that travels: most understand that this god has many faces and many names, but much beyond that is lost.
Clergy structure is completely lost.
The Red Sun is a curse upon the world by Hemangh, sent in mysterious unknowable fury

**Desharene Faith**
New, distributed clergy focused on sending people to the afterlife is extremely popular. Clergy does not need significant knowledge, and rituals are comparatively cheap.
The Red Sun is used to legitimize the newish Desharene faith; seen as the promised coming of death. The Desharene priests were sent through divine fortune to send believers to the afterlife.

**Cult of Isakash**
Red is an important color to the Akshani, for it is the color of the world. The Red Sun was an aftereffect of the great eruption that destroyed their homeland. More than anyone, they see the Red Sun as the victory of the Evil Gods over the entire world. After the eruption of the Uruvand Traps, many Isakash cults spread, heralding the coming of magic that could protect people from the destruction. Isakash cults were taken up quickly in Nos Mori and expanded. They found their way into aristocratic circles of the classical civilizations before the eruption. After the eruption, Isakash worship spread quickly under the guise of an Apocryphal savior.

Isakash cult doesn't like Hemanghism; although Hemanghism is flexible, the Isakash cult believes all gods except Isakash are evil and must be distanced. Isakash forms the beginnings of an exclusive religion.
1. scholarly priest-wizards, usually must have a group
2. complex, though incredibly powerful, rituals and practices
3. Isakash is the only Good god, all others are evil. Monolatric.

The Desharene faith, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of accepting the unifying Many Faced God. This happens, and the new syncretic Nos Mori common faith holds:
1. ascetic clergy, some static some migratory
2. cheap ritual to pass souls to a decent afterlife (not really a paradise)
3. all gods are aspects of a single god, though each are like emotions that can be supplicated to

So, two divergent faiths in Nos Mori in the early time of the Red Sun: Isakash cults and Desharene faith.

These faiths settle by 28k BBT.

How did these faiths change over the next 3000 years?

**Desharene faith**
The Desharene faith emphasizes the common man and the power of the Many Faced God over mortals. The Desharenes are the mortal messengers of the Many Faced God, who is bringing the highest punishment, death, to true martyrs of the faith to test them of their devotion. The Desharene rituals free the souls of the dead from the world so that they can pass quietly into the afterlife. Some Desharene priests begin to act as psychopomps, fully engaging with the souls of the dead to guide them to the afterlife. Most, however, continue their life of absolute asceticism and hold a semi-nomadic lifestyle. Importantly, the afterlife remains non-salvation in the main body of faith. This, then is the highest test of the faith of the devout. Eventually, the Desharenes preach, the Red Sun will pass and the Gates of the afterlife will open, leading all the martyred dead to Salvation.

The Desharene faith expands its pantheon of gods' Aspects to include new emotions and qualities, reflecting the evolving emotional and psychological needs of the people during the crisis.

Return focus on agricultural aspects and an abundance of festival days to celebrate agricultural cycle, also days to focus on martyred dead.

Devotion can be shown to a variety of Aspects, though it is held that devotion to some is worth more than devotion to others. Devotion can be shown typically through small sacrifice, ritual, prayer, etc. Amulets and charms dedicated to aspects is also a sign of devotion.

Radical sect: devotion is shown through flagellance; death is not enough--a life of pain is the true devotion to the Many Faced God. These sectarians preach that the world will end at the turning of the Red Sun, and those that pay true pennance to the Face of Pain will return in the world born anew.

Radical sect: a syncretic Isakash cult, taken into the Desharene faith as an Aspect of the Many Faced God. The scholarly monastic cults are integrated slowly into some parts of the Dark Age society. Magic is used by the Desharenes to heal, protect, purify, deal pain, etc.

...The Red Sun as a symbol of a divine reckoning or a necessary prelude to a transformed world.

**Isakash cult**
During the period of the Red Sun, the Isakash cult strengthens its theology that all deities except Isakash are evil. The wizards preach this to the point of violence. They exercise their rituals of protection over the small communities that support them. They believe the environmental changes can be protected through the consumption of mercury and other ecological rituals, often leading to the older members going insane and having visions and hallucinations. These hallucinations serve to strengthen faith and popularize the cult. Generally, the Isakash cult believes that the world is being destroyed by the Evil Gods, but Isakash will protect her servants and raise the world from the sea of blood. There is a moral correctness in worshipping Isakash, for she is the only god able to protect the world. Red Wizards train, then set out in travelling bands to spread Isakash's protection to members of their ethnic identity.
Headquarters are in the Wesaxum mountains, north of Tellin.

This is the state of the faiths of Nos Mori at the time of Sagodad and the Classical kingdoms.





**Religion in Perakor**
High elf religions were pretty polytheistic / dualistic. They were astronomers and constellations played into their religion heavily, had significant beliefs about reincarnation and afterlife, prophecy + divination.

The Red Sun would centrally affect the Yedris and wider people of Perakor as astronomy is central to many of their beliefs. Prophesied before the actual event, the Red Sun was expected and tied to the reincarnation of some of the greatest evils and perils of the Yedris. The prophecy read that the coming of the Red Sun would bring the downfall of all civilization, but also a pair of twins would be born. These twins would become saviors, and they would be reborn repeatedly until great cities were once again risen.

Religions that emphasized the separation of priest and society (Iryesians, Voin, etc) will almost certainly die out.

During the Red Sun, these saviors were indeed born as society collapsed around them. They became scholars and created early archives of the knowledge of the Yedris. Throughout their many lives they guarded the archives, became leaders of many sorts, and slowly led the shattered people back to civilization. The civilizations that arose after the Red Sun were not set back as much as others around them.
Throughout the long crisis the Yedrist religion shifted significantly. The art of the astronomer priest was practically entirely lost, and priests of the Red Sun practiced a simplified form of divination and haruspicy. Reincarnation continued, though it too became simplified in its understanding.

### The Red Sun passes and the Classical World rises

With the brightening of the Red Sun, a gradual change must come over both Nos Mori faiths as they alter their beliefs.

The Desharenes spoke of salvation for the afterlife upon the passing of the Red Sun. While at the time the prophecy was simply that: a hope that one day the end of such a disaster will come, now it has actually come to pass. However, this was a gradual change--not an overnight event. The priests slowly phased out this part of their beliefs--no longer is the death and destruction a sign of devotion to be rewarded with salvation. Will the rise of the Classical period, much more focus is put on other, active devotions. Further, the Desharenes believe the afterlife is fundamentally a paradise to reward these devotions to the Many Faced God.
The Desharenes do more to codify their believes and stories. Art prominently features the Red Sun opening to the afterlife.
The society's intellectual development might encourage philosophical inquiry into the nature of the Many Faced God and the relationship between the Aspects. Philosophers and scholars could explore the concept of a many-faced god in greater depth.

The Isakash cult was always much smaller--at this time, they are a radical minority in Sagobad. With the passing of the Red Sun, the cultists believe that Isakash has finally defeated the Evil Gods and imprisoned them / destroyed them / made them weak. By this point, the cultists believe that all other deities besides Isakash are weak tricksters, demons playing the fool of their followers. Red Wizards find their faith to be shrinking, as Desharene mages are slowly replacing the utility of the Red Wizards. The cult of Isakash begins to undergo a religious renaissance, recalling ancient knowledge and power and driving towards more radical rituals and acts. This leads to the reconstruction / re-imagination / refinding of the ancient writings of Sidakai.
Very importantly, by the end of this time Isakash cult belief redefines and re-integrates sacrifice and magic. The sacrifice of materials and the performance of ritual actions in the act of spell casting is now sacred and akin to the devout sacrifice for a purely religious ritual.

By the end of the classical period, the Nos Mori region is again humming with magical practices. From the radical and estranged Isakash cult to several magico-religious sects of the Desharene Aspects, magical ability is spreading throughout the region.


**The Classical Age in the Northern Hemisphere**

In the later stages of the Red Sun the people of western Perakor already make their resurgence due to the leadership of the Twins. The period of 27,000 BBT - 21,500 BBT covers the majority of the Classical Age from the beginning of the Iron Age to the beginning of the Roman Empire.

Great shifts must occur in the beliefs of the people during this time, but I'll focus on the things that remain in the religion:

dualism
reincarnation (in some more abstract regard maybe?)

Things that can be added:

1. Ethical code and virtues
2. Philosophical schools surrounding the nature of reincarnation and the Gods
3. Expanded, new cosmology and view of the heavens

Early Vedas mature 27700
>Neo-Yedrism includes annals or poetic epics describing the history of the people and their methods of worship

Life of Zoroaster 27700
>A reformer is born, collapsing Neo-Yedrism from a polytheistic religion to a purely dualistic one, beginning the evolution of the core theology

Pre-Socratic philosophy 24940
>Philosophical ideas about the nature of the world begin to foment

Rise of monolatric belief from Hebrews 24940
>The pure dualistic beliefs cement. The Neo-Yedris faith revolves around 

Life of the Buddha 24580
Life of Confucius 24580
>Another significant reformer rises, adding a requirement of ethics and virtues to the belief in reincarnation.

Aristotle, father of induction and empiricism 23740
>lacking significant magic like the Akshani, the classical Yedris push hard into science, especially optics, medicine, etc
Optics 23620
Systemization of medecine and surgery 23140

Roman Empire 22540

Fracturing of Judaism, Life of Paul 22060
>formation of a neo-Yedrist faction that ends up with the largest influence on the Heavenly Sinisar Empire.

### The Plane Race and the Classical Empires



The ancestral kingdoms that rose out of the Red Sun and dabbled in the first real magic systems held a religion that combined Hemanghism and Akshani faiths, altered and boiled in the Red Sun dark age. Generally, A single deity is held, but with dualistic tendencies. Red is a very imporant color in the religion, symbolizing good (magic, power). The sun is also tied to good, while the moon and darkness is tied to evil. The single deity has several aspects / faces, split diametrically into Good and Bad, Benevolent and Malevolent. This deity is often called by somewhat-learned outsiders to be the God of Many Faces. Sacrifice is very important to this deity, which ties into spell component sacrifice.

During the time of the Plane Race, a new religion was rising. A once small sect of the Many Faced God faith, more explicitely polytheistic, preaches beyond ethnic boundaries. This faith propagates throughout the common folk of the Plane Race civilizations, and is generally opposed to the Old Red Gods.

Eventually human faiths come into play--inspired by Confusianism.



Human faith
[early Sashism - remnant Akshani] -> [Tanorian Sashism - Sashism + Sagobad]
[Sagobad faith - Thandairian + Hemangh] -> [Tanorian faith - Sagobad]
[Legacy Krinican - Pisk + Krinican hyper dualism] -> [new Classical Krinican]

Cycle of Twins
The universe is in a perpetual dance between Light and Shadow, Grown and Decay, Black and White. These forces are not Good or Evil--but essential aspects of existence. They represent Creation and Destruction in all their forms. The power of these forces, tied to two Gods, waxes and wanes in cycles.

Thesmata (Mother of Stars)
Shynedar (Son of Storms)

reveres two primary deities, Lumina, the embodiment of Light and Creation, and Umbra, the personification of Shadow and Destruction. Each deity is seen as equally powerful and necessary, with their interactions shaping the world.

seek to maintain harmony in their lives by embracing both Light and Shadow. They believe that by acknowledging the duality within themselves and the world, they can find inner peace and enlightenment.

prescribes a path of moderation and balance in all aspects of life. Extremes, whether in behavior or belief, are discouraged, as they disrupt the delicate equilibrium of existence.

rituals often involve the interplay of Light and Shadow symbolism. Candlelit ceremonies, where candles are simultaneously lit and extinguished, represent the ebb and flow of cosmic forces. Followers also engage in meditative practices to explore their inner duality.

Balancism emphasizes moral responsibility and ethical decision-making. Followers are encouraged to weigh the consequences of their actions on the greater balance of the world.

Balancist temples are designed to reflect the religion's dualistic beliefs. They feature contrasting elements, such as light-filled sanctuaries and shadowy alcoves, to symbolize the coexistence of opposing forces.

Within the faith, there are ongoing theological debates about the nature of Light and Shadow. Some sects emphasize one aspect over the other, while others advocate for a strict balance. These debates lead to the formation of various branches and interpretations of Balancism.

Balancism greatly influences the art of the Renaissance era. Paintings, sculptures, and literature often explore the interplay between opposing forces, creating a rich and complex cultural tapestry.
