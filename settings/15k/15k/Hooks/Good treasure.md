While wearing this armor, you can understand and speak Abyssal.
_**Curse.**_ Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the [remove curse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/remove-curse) spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities. Further, even after this initial Remove Curse, the wearer is afflicted with an injunction into the Realm of Uzaxuk: on any roll of Natural 1, you are afflicted by a bout of madness (as the Short Madness table, for 1 round.) Dispel Evil and Good (5th level spell) can banish this injunction.
The breastplate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates and thick layers of padding underneath the armor.
