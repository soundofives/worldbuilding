Resurrection--re-binding the nexus of a deceased being to a body--is a perversion of fundamental concepts, though in a way it is not unlike the creation of avatars (a process that requires the binding of one nexus to another) and non-intelligent undead (which requires animating a body through the simulation of a nexus). The creation of intelligent undead is very similar to resurrection, though in the first case the nexus bound to the corpse comes from a spirit cursed to never cross the Veil. 

Therein lies the largest difference between the creation of intelligent undead and the true resurrection of a living person: the Veil.

When something dies, the fate of its nexus is controlled by the cognizant and collective belief of those around it and the active participation of Autochthons relevant to that belief. Essentially, they pass into the/an afterlife of the belief system held by the society or culture they belong to. In a world of realized beliefs, religions naturally, generally, accept the underlying validity of the power of many deities--though they may still argue about the nature of those deities and other aspects of the theology. Because of this, there is a generally held belief that a worshiper will be at the whims of the deities or deity that they hold after death. However, for those that hold no deity or belong to an immature belief system, there may not be any fully realized afterlife or deity to claim the nexus. In these cases, several things can occur:
1. Many belief systems lay some sort of claim to nonbelievers--this can lead to the non-believer being led to the afterlife of the strongest religion around their location of death, or to a purgatory of judgement between the multiple afterlives if several powerful religions exist.
2. Their nexus can remain in place, possibly becoming a spirit, ghost, or other kind of undead.

To further complicate this, the power of an Autochthon might be contested by the power of some other claimant to the being's soul, such as a demon, devil, or other outsider.

So, what does this mean for Rabbitouille?
1. What are his beliefs?
2. Might his curse have something to do with an outside claimant to his soul?
3. If his soul was led to the purgatory between the Myriad and the Cycladene faiths, what becomes of him?
