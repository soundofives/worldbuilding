*Where's the money?*

---

The Last and First City and the Shadaean Empire more broadly holds the beating coin purses of millions of people. Local economies outside the LFC might look very different to what I describe here, so take this as a guide to the economy of just the LFC.

There are several broad, fluid socioeconomic classes that fit most of the almost 3 million people in the LFC:

| Social Status               | Min Income /mo | Population Percent |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Poor, unskilled             | 6 gp           | 60                 |
| Modest laborer, mercenary   | 30 gp          | 25                 |
| Skilled tradesman, merchant | 60 gp          | 9                  |
| Wealthy                     | 120 gp         | 5                  |
| Aristocrat                  | 600 gp         | 1                  |

People generally live to their means--or even a little over. Saving money is a slow and difficult process. If someone is trying to save money, they might be able to hide away 10% of their income each month. What do people spend their money on?

- Poor, unskilled peoples spend every copper their money on food, warmth, and basic needs for themselves or their family. Oftentimes a household might only have one or two members that earn money.
- Modest laborers are much the same, though they can afford slight luxuries, like feastly meals on festivals or the occasional potion, scroll, or fancy weapon after some time saving up.
- Skilled tradesmen, merchants, and those rising up through the gift of patronage might find themselves easily earning 60-120 gp personally, each month. These people can afford nicer homes, larger families, and more comforts in life. They might have art pieces, a few spell scrolls stored away for a rainy day, and they could--reluctantly--afford a health potion if they or a family member grew horribly ill or was injured.
- The wealthy bankers, high guild members, entrepreneurial businessmen, master thieves, mercenary captains, and others of high-society are awash in cash. They can afford to show off their wealth--and are often pressured to. These are the people who typically strive to offer patronage to rising proteges. Offering patronage is key to fitting in with this level of society: people who carouse at wealthy banquets and festivals, wear finer clothes, eat nicer food, and can afford to hire and control others. The wealthy might have several personal "common" enchanted items, and sometimes they have a rarer heirloom. They can more easily afford potions, books, education, etc, especially with the help of their own patrons--the people who often boosted them into this social class in the first place.
- The aristocracy is a league of its own. The people of this upper-class world skyrocket into a world of wealth that it is difficult to return from. Investments, banking ventures, valuable pratronage, fine arts, expensive collections, magical education, you name it. Many aristocrats don't even work--they gain their money through the steady growth of the economy providing interest on their investments. A standard aristocrat might have several hundred-thousand gold pieces in capitol. The absolute wealthiest have millions of gold. An aristocrat family might have a collection of valuable magic items and heirlooms (easily 500 gp - 1500 gp value, occasionally up to 2000 gp or much more for recent acquisitions), have whole groups, companies, or factions under their control, send their children to the finest universities, etc. The wealthiest family, the Ishurs, are worth about 18 million gold pieces.

How much spending money could someone expect to have, anyway?
- Monthly Income: 30 gp
- Housing (30%): 9 gp
- Basic Needs (40%): 12 gp
- Discretionary Spending or saving (30%): 9 gp
	- This might include guild dues, which can be ~3 gp per month.
Most people spend almost all of their discretionary cash to keep up with their life style--but its cash that they can expect to spend on class-level stuff every month.


Some calculations on the wealthy:
The total wealth of the LFC is about 11 billion gp (https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/demographics/). The top 1% (about 22,000 people) each have an average worth of 100,000 gp. This makes up about 20% of the economic worth of the city. The very top have about 5% of the worth of the city, which equals today's US breakdown where the top 1% have about 25% of the wealth.
