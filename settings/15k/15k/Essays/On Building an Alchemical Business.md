You must create the potions and sell them.
Creation:
1. grow the ingredients, acquire bottles, equipment, and labor
Sell:
1. Find buyers, transport products, sell to alchemists, merchants, or directly to people (law students, etc)
Complications:
1. Taxes on businesses and valuable shipments through Gates (can be smuggled at higher risk)
2. Drawing alchemical guild attention (pay guild dues, certain percentage of profit)
3. Drawing thieves attention (hire bodyguards)

Who to sell to:
1. The Apothecary Guild manages the crafting and sale of potions in the LFC. They sell potions directly at apothecary shops, where most potions are made in-house. If the party doesn't want to set up a shop front and instead wants to sell to other guild members, they can do so--though at a reduced value, as the apothecary will want to make a profit for their troubles. This kind of distribution is relatively common throughout the LFC, as some evening out stock is useful for the market landscape.
2. The Merchants Guild. If the party instead wants to focus their sales *outside* the LFC, they can sell to the Merchants Guild who handle import and export to the LFC.


For the night poppy potions, alchemists will want to make 25 gp--this will require them to buy the potion from the PCs for ~40 gp. (They buy for 40 and sell for 65)
The total profit can thus be increased by increasing the value of the potion without appreciably increasing its production cost.

For merchants, they could export these potions outside the city. The goods would increase in value (being a city commodity) by ~25-50% depending on some simplified supply and demand, but the merchants would want to take a 10% or more cut. Because of the addictive nature of the substance, the demand will remain high always, except in towns that deal with addiction epidemics and have crack downs.

So if the merchants value the potions at 85 gold, they think the buyers will buy it for 60 gold and sell it for at least 85. The rural apothecaries will earn 25 gp, and the merchants want a 20% profit. They'll buy the potions from the PCs for 48 gold.

How does the hauling guild play in? The Hauling Guild can handle distribution throughout the LFC (to the 2550 apothecary shops). They do so for a average rate of 2 coppers / mile per shipment. In the LFC, each city is approx 7 square miles, so perimeter to center is 3.5 miles. Then to perimeter of next city is another 3.5 miles for a total of 7 miles. Thus, a single shipment is 14 miles, or 28 copper. A guild-rate discount is 50%.

### Contracts 
Right now:
- Hauling Guild contract: sell potions to LFC Apothecaries Guild for avg of 50 gold, then take 10% total profits to re-distribute to Apothecaries. Equals out to ~45 gp per potion.
- Adnan sells 15 potions per month at 45 gp per potion.

**Another 10% will be taken for guild membership.**

Possible:
- Merchant contract: buy potions for 48-54 gold, depending on Cha check. Outside the city, so no license needed--but there is more risk involved. 5% chance of disaster from bandits, pirates, or weather for each shipment (month) of this contract. The payment comes *after* the sale, when the merchant returns from their venture.
- Thief contract: buy potions for 48 (they take 25%), sell them illegally inside the city--no license needed.


The Bank of Miros is funding this venture. They require using the Hauling Guild. They also control the Apothecaries Guild, 

Consequences of a successful business:
Much like the East Indies Trading Company in England, the boom-or-bust wealth it brought to the lower classes that participated in it threatened the aristocracy. The traditionally wealthy looked down on the "uneducated", "sloppy", "uncivil" merchants of the Company. This is a consequence of the success of the Crew's business: they'll provoke the ire of the traditionally wealthy, who might seek to take their success from them, bring disaster upon them, or otherwise embarrass them.

## The Banks dealings with the Crew:

The Ishurs are now involved with the Poppy Potion business, as one of their bankers invested in it. However, how would the Ishurs actually react if they found out their bank was protecting the interests of these mercenaries turned businessmen?
- More importantly, the Bank of Miros is tightly bound to the Cycladenes on the surface. They can't be seen funding known anti-Cycladene terrorists. They MUST intervene. If they stop funding NOW and cut ties, they can publicly denounce the business--but they don't want to risk losing the ties to the Crew. They see the value in the entrepreneurship and ability of the mercenaries. No...they want to fund them, MORE, but secretly. Cut ties publicly, but help them in secret. They can't offer their own lawyers anymore...but they CAN offer a new distribution deal. These are luxury health potions and must be marketed to a luxury market: the newly hyper-wealthy mercenary guilds. Then, part of the potion profit goes back to the Bank. Essentially, the Bank cuts the profits of the mercenaries and takes more for itself from the military-industrial complex. So...they want the Crew licensed. They can't publically fund them, but can set up a new distribution scheme w/ the hauling guild to supply in bulk to the Brothers' Company and the Red Company. They will help sell over the market saturation limit too, via one cell of the Thieves Guild associated with the Hauling Guild.
- The Bank also supports Rabbitouille's idea of smuggling potions to Law students--they want to cripple the government with addiction too. Plus, moving books around requires Mercenaries. The Bank will essentially get even more money when they bring Mercs in on this and tell the Mercs that this was all their idea to get more usage.**Mercs will start to up their prices! Good for Bank.** How will the Bank support all this? More potions. More money. What's limiting the business right now? Alchemists, licensure.
- The criminal factions see a new influx of wealth and they want in. They'll start hitting potion shipments...which the Bank of Miros HATES because they're the ones insuring the alchemists guild for damages.
- 

***!!!*** Also, if the Crew gets licensed then the Guild will require them to share their recipe. This will hamstring the Bank of Miros' plans by allowing other vendors to offer the same product, rather than funnelling all the money for the poppy potions into the hands of the Crew, who then will give that money back to the Bank in exchange for magic items. Those magic items aren't a loss for the Bank, as they're old and have appreciated significant value. Essentially, old magic items are an investment that the Bank will be making money off of. **They don't want the Crew to be licensed.** How do you sell 100s of potions without being licensed? Hauling Guild. Thieves Guild. Covert movement of goods, largest shipments have falsified documents.

Summary:
The Bank seeks to use the Crew as a new tool to cripple the Bureaucracy and the Mercenary Guilds. By targeting these groups with luxury addictive potions, they will drain funds and force heavier reliance on the Bank. Thus, the Bank will gain leverage over both groups. Further, the Crew will funnel much of their money **back** to the Bank by purchasing old magic items. These magic items were old investments by the Bank, and they'll make significant profit by selling them to the Crew. Because the Bank relies on the Crew having control of this market, they don't want the recipe getting out.

a. If this is public: the Bank funds potions that use poppies (something their already invested in) that get sold to the Mercenaries. So, essentially, they're profiting off of the war--but not directly. But it's still there.
b. **If this is not public: there is no tie between the Bank and the war.**

What can the Bank gain from this, monetarily:
If the Crew sells 200 potions per month and the Bank takes 20%, then the Bank profits 2000 gp / month. That's ~24,000 per year, which is huge. In 5 months, the Crew can ramp up production to the growing addicted mercenary groups. The mercenaries are drained of wealth, and the Bank profits. The Mercs seek new recruits and push them into the religious war--which further drains the resources of the Churches. Thus, all groups turn to the Bank for loans. The Bank loans out--but carefully, knowing full well that eventually they will re-possess the Merc groups and use them to plunder the Churches and Merc vaults. Eventually, the only player left will be the Bank.

So what happens?
1. The Bank cuts public ties with the Crew.
2. The Bank stops giving 300 gp / month.

3. A new deal. The Bank wants your business to continue--larger than ever. We want you to focus your sales on Mercs and Law students, selling left overs individually.
4. New contracts require that you cannot get licensed--the recipe cannot be publicly produced. This will require forgery to move bulk shipments through Gates. The Bank provides contacts to a skilled Forger.
5. The Bank takes 0%.
6. In 5 months, you must be producing 200 potions per month.
7. The Bank offers safety. If the High Alchemists in the Guild start to go sniffing, the Bank will take care of it or warn the Crew. Further, a vault will be provided for the Crew to safeguard their earnings.


Bank will offer new avenues of sale:
1. More structured sale to Mercenaries
2. Implementation of sale to law students
3.
