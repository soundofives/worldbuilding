The players can generally do four types of challenges under the DnD mechanics:

Making combat faster and easier

don't use exclusively crowds. throw a few big nastys in there too.
play the monsters smarter, stay away from sir hugs-a-lot and pick off the scrawny wizards first. let your monsters retreat, they can come back later with reinforcements.
use a variety of monsters with resistances and a variety of attacks, make them roll saves. AOE's work great against big groups. flying monsters can keep their distance, ghosts and elementals make grappling a trick.
sneak up on them and fight guerilla style. Displacer beasts are my all time favorite monster.
set traps for the players and use terrain for your advantage, the archers are up in the trees!
give them alternative objectives, protect the relic, escort the prince, stop the ritual before time runs out!
