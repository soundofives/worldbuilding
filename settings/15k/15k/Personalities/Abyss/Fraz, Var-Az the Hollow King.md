The Rakshasas are demons borne of the primal fears and nightmares of the people of the Forges of Creation. They are scheming demons--rather than the pure bloodshed that many demons seek, rakshasas derive pleasure from the eternal struggle and degrading hope of their victims.
**"Above and beyond any external reward, rakshasas pursue evil ends to kindle hatred in the eyes of their victims, then watch it gradually turn to despair as the poor unfortunates are made to understand the true degree to which their intellect was unfit to contest that of a rakshasa."**
So, akin to how Grazzt lifts his worshippers and victims up to the greatest points of pleasure, Rakshasas revel in the futile struggle that ends in glorious failure. This, too, is what Fraz loves: he loves to see his plans unfold. He loves watching the pawns in the game fight against him, only to realize they're far too deep in his web to escape. He loves to be hated. To be fought. All this, and his victims still lose.

The most powerful rakshasa is Fraz Urb'luu, an ancient Demon Lord. On the inception of the Blood War, rakshasas escaped the Abyss and spread across the Planescape, using their powers of illusion, deception, and shapeshifting to hide in plain sight. Not all rakshasas serve Fraz, but those that do are given a means of protection in return for their servitude: Fraz rips their hearts from their chest, granting them freedom from their most vital weakness but forcing them into eternal domination. These are the hollow rajahs.
