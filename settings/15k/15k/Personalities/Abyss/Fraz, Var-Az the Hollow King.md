The Rakshasas are demons borne of the primal fears and nightmares of the people of the Forges of Creation. They are scheming demons--rather than the pure bloodshed that many demons seek, rakshasas derive pleasure from the eternal struggle and degrading hope of their victims.
**"Above and beyond any external reward, rakshasas pursue evil ends to kindle hatred in the eyes of their victims, then watch it gradually turn to despair as the poor unfortunates are made to understand the true degree to which their intellect was unfit to contest that of a rakshasa."**
So, akin to how Grazzt lifts his worshippers and victims up to the greatest points of pleasure, Rakshasas revel in the futile struggle that ends in glorious failure. This, too, is what Fraz loves: he loves to see his plans unfold. He loves watching the pawns in the game fight against him, only to realize they're far too deep in his web to escape. He loves to be hated. To be fought. All this, and his victims still lose.

The most powerful rakshasa is Fraz Urb'luu, an ancient Demon Lord. On the inception of the Blood War, rakshasas escaped the Abyss and spread across the Planescape, using their powers of illusion, deception, and shapeshifting to hide in plain sight. Not all rakshasas serve Fraz, but those that do are given a means of protection in return for their servitude: Fraz rips their hearts from their chest, granting them freedom from their most vital weakness but forcing them into eternal domination. These are the hollow rajahs.

Fraz is a trickster. An illusionist. His schemes involve making the heroes think they're winning, that they're doing good, but in the end seeing their faces turn to despair as they realize that all along, Fraz has been in control or that they've actually being working towards his evil ends.

Fraz became Demon King by deception, manipulation, illusion, and trickery. He tricked the Pale Night into donning the Last Word. He deceives Demon Kings into coming to his realm just so he can coerce them into his service. He's a bitch.
- Fraz can disjunct, but the Godtrap had a back-fire mechanic that disjuncted Fraz's own magic, making  him quite weak for a long time. Fraz is still trying to recover from this.
Something Fraz can do that is trickster-y: he tries to manipulate people into ruining the Empire. He is sewing chaos through the War, spreading lies and prophecies about the murder of Vecna, etc. He wants to see the beauty of the Last and First City rip itself apart. Further, he has taken the Crew as his personal play things in carrying out this doom. At the same time, he wants to see Orcus trapped forever and to retake his position as Demon King.

Fraz is arrogant, but yet fearful of his own position. He's like the genius that could use his brilliance to do good in the world, but instead he uses it only to tear down others. Fraz is an evil trickster. An illusionist. A manipulator. More than a simple prankster, Fraz's tricks and schemes are entirely and fundamentally malevolent. He is as a rakshasa,
"Above and beyond any external reward, rakshasas pursue evil ends to kindle hatred in the eyes of their victims, then watch it gradually turn to despair as the poor unfortunates are made to understand the true degree to which their intellect was unfit to contest that of a rakshasa."
He desires rule because he views himself as the only being intelligent enough, worthy enough, to rule. While his deeper, viler schemes seep into the roots of the world over millennia, he passes the time with tricks and twists, manipulating puppets with the goal of making his victims fight tooth and nail to keep the things they love, but in the end turning to despair as they realize they never could win against him. He loves to approach his manipulations from the guise weakness or foolishness--it is to him, the most fantastic of all ironies and deceptions that someone like him could ever be a fool.

Fraz and the Myriad:
Fraz-Urb'luu's Cults of Deception pose as worshipers of a divine power, infiltrating or founding congregations and precipitating crises, pushing worshipers to make ever-escalating moral compromises in the supposed pursuit of an ever out-of-reach greater good. Such cults are often led or supported by one of the succubi or rakshasas that form the core of the Great Deceiver's cohort.

Fraz loves the Myriad because it is a religion that steals the life and independence of others. It promises good and hope while undermining tradition and faith. The Myriad is indeed much older than Fraz and his manipulations, but early on in the life of the church Fraz's rakshasas found their places and steered it on a crash-course with the Cycladenes.
