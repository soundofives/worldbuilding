I've also got unresolved Brother's Company business including a trial,
the drama between the guild heads,

As far as Adnan's business, it was the connections that Adnan made that propelled him onto the guild counsel. If Maximo wants to hold any real leverage on the counsel he will need those connections. As far as the guild consolidation, to begin with, Maximo wants to bring the hauling, enchanting, potion brewing, and maybe weapon manufacturing guilds under his thumb. Further down the line, he has dreams for a larger mercenary business empire with most or all of the guilds more or less in the fold either through deals or through more martial persuasion.

Hauling, alchemy, weapons -> Bank has major stock in their actions and governance
Incantators are independent of Cycladene and Bank; but are influenced by Nystul as Archlord of Arcana.

To achieve these plans, Maximo will have to fold the Brother's Company into the Bank (they are already quite tight partners) or break the Bank down and steal their businesses.

In any case, he has grand ambitions that involve the Bank.
