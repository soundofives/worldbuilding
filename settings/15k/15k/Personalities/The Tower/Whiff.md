An air-genasi refugee, father of [[Breeze]]. Whiff is a jovial man, happy to be working the bar. [[Zagyg| Zygag]] rescued Whiff and Breeze many years ago while Breeze was still young while they were still escaping the Unravelling. They were caught up with Gith and Slaad pirates.

Whiff is a seasoned bartender with a calming presence. His air-genasi heritage is evident in his sky-blue skin, airy demeanor, and a perpetually gentle breeze that seems to follow him. He's skilled in mixing exotic and magical drinks, a talent honed through years of practice.


Whiff's specialty drink is an icy-cold Absinthe cocktail, the Necromancer, distilled in the rime of the Unravelling.
