Who is Inspector Jeffers?
A. He's Jeffers; or a version of him. A time-travelling adventurer in command of Taregil. He is the One Eyed Bard, who eventually retires to Rusva and gives up Taregil to Barkeep.
B. He's the Emperor, in disguise, going about and keeping an eye on the Crew for Fraz. Kalma chose the name Jeffers because Jeffers visited him before with Taregil in an attempt to stop the war that would eventually destroy the world. The One Eyed Bard failed, and realized that Kalma - Hykhe - Vecna was truly evil. He is, after all, a vile experiment of Creation. This failure led the One Eyed Bard to retire to the Rusva countryside.
The Crew got a hint of Jeffers' power when Carric studied his mannerisms -- Jeffers / Emperor is infused with divine strength, making his ability scores insanely high.
Jeffers feigns investigating the Crew's crimes. In truth, he's been tasked with keeping an eye on the Crew by Fraz.

What does Jeffers know?
- A band of kids were killed; a witness claimed Tower mercenaries had killed all the kids.'
	- CRIME: Child murder.
	- **Hasur Highfallow would know more, but likely wouldn't give clean answers unless he was dead.**
- The Crew is growing night poppies in Stardale and using the poppies for a potion business out of a warehouse, originally funded in part by the Bank. Their original warehouse was burned in a horrible accident, killing an Inspector and several guards. The Crew has moved to a new warehouse outside of Sinisa. Their products seem licensed, but a confiscated license is revealed to be a counterfit. The potions are primarily being sold to the mercenaries and law students, though many are also sold to miscellaneous people. When the Crew seemed to run aground with the Bank, they cut ties. Now the Crew's business seems to rely mostly on the Hauling Guild and counterfitting--agents of both groups are allied with the Bank, though, so it's likely that the Bank is still working with the Crew. A mysterious man has been seen with the Crew on several occasions, including the incident with Dariush Ishur. It was at this point that Jeffers realized who he was--a high-up bank thug named Borlaw. It seemed that the Bank did not want to be publically seen working with the Crew as they attacked the Cycladenes. This made sense--the Bank saw an opportunity to make money, however, it caused harm to their allies the Cycladenes.
	- If the Bank is involved, then they likely have direction in what the Crew is doing. **Why sell to Mercenaries and Lawyers?** Well, it seemed recently that the Mercenaries were all the talk. They were everywhere. Perhaps it was as simple as an obvious new market...
	- Through Adnan, Jeffers learned that the Bank and the Mercenaries cut a profit sharing deal
- The Crew went out on a job with the Tower to a distant land and returned with rumors of a powerful artifact in Zagyg's possession. The Crew, however, seemed to have broken ties with the Tower and left on a sour note. Another man--golden skinned with white hair--was seen travelling with the Crew. **Why did the Crew leave the Tower? Did this break have anything to do with Zagyg's supposed destruction of the Obsidian Citadel?**
- The Obsidian Citadel was attacked while the Crew was supposedly hiding out there--they have claimed to several people that the attacker was Zagyg, though no-one was left alive who witnessed the disaster. Rumors circulated afterward that the Citadel was destroyed in a horrible magical experiment gone wrong. These rumors seems to pop up randomly in high-class bars and inns. (a Tower shapeshifter is sewing rumors). **What does the Crew know that the rest of the world doesnt?**
- The Crew was seen at a Cycladene ball, during which they kidnapped the archlord of Coin, Dariush Ishur. He was seen alive the next week, supposedly having recovered from his wounds. Why did they kidnap him? Was it for a ransom?
	- CRIME: Kidnapping and ransoming an official of the government.
- The Crew has since relocated to somewhere that Jeffers does not know.
- Adnan suddenly died after strange magical phenomena associated with the new beholder potions warped his house.According to party goers, the Crew was present. **Perhaps they know more...**
	- CRIME: High Murder of a Guild Master

Jeffers can present this evidence to get the Crew arrested if they are in imminent danger.
