The Duskivaines are an old and powerful family in the Last and First City.

Milo's great-great grandparents carried the Cycle of Twins to its height in the 147th century. Their daughter, Nezana Duskivaine, went on to head the Cycladenes until her death in the 143rd century. Their son, Kasra, founded the Bank of Miros and blazed the path forward for the entire economy of the Empire until his death in the 145th century. His family, the House of Ishur, holds the Bank to this day. Nezana's descendants, the Duskivaines, still control the Cycladenes.

The Duskivaines span several factions:
-the Cycle of Twins
-the Shynedar-Kai
-the Bureaucracy
With a minor fragment into the Circle of Eight. (Nystul)

elves have avg lifespan of 360 years, max of 1000
Elders:
Laven (15,082 - 14,839) + Bojia (15,152 - 14,474)

Thoughts:
Nezana Duskivaine is the original matriarch of the Cycladene church. She was supposed to rule alongside her brother Kasra, but he gave up his position to found the Bank of Miros. This was the initial schism in the family. This left Nezana to lead the church alongside her child daughter, Dragana. After Nezana's death, Dragana ruled alongside her sister Saira. Dragana's eldest daughter, Testra has passed on the succession. Testra is in poor health, and Dragana passed her up on the succession. This led Testra and Talmir to push their children extremely hard. Milo ran away, and Luvomas entered into the Shynedar-Kai. The current heirs to the Cycladene matriarchy are Saira II and her brother Bozidir.
