##### Before the Shadaean Empire
---
***29k - 25k BBT - Red Sun*** 
The story of Hykhe's rise  begins with the eruption of the Uruvand traps in the 29th millennium Before the Burned Times (BBT). The period after this eruption is called the **Red Sun**.

During the Red Sun, a human-colonized shard of the Feywild injuncted with Asfalon, beginning the slow process of the eventual #PlaneRace. 

The Red Sun saw the writing of early poetry and myths, the lives of some of the most important mythical figures, and the development of theological foundations that would create the important religions of the coming ages.

---
***25k - 23k BBT - Classical Kingdoms***
Eventually, around the peak of the glacial period ~25k (or later), The southern hemisphere begins again in a second Axial Age and the northern hemisphere restarts again with another late Bronze Age. One of the most developed of these kingdoms to have an impact on the later world was Sagobad on the mid-eastern coast of Huroma, the former region of the cities of Omanusia. The spiritual successor of the old great kingdoms of Nos Mori, Sagobad led the region in magical theology and heralded a classical Renaissance of forgotten knowledge.

In the northern hemisphere, a new hotbed of civilization was growing around the lakes of western Luazil and the around the Luazil-Beaytu straight. This was the land of Kuhorik. While the cities of Kuhorik were budding, the war-torn Perakor, hugely destroyed by the collapse and the invasion of the northern Pisk into the south, was regrowing. A kingdom shouldering the legacy of Krinica was the torchbearer for the rebirth of this land.

This period saw the maturation and setting of some of the important religious concepts of the Plane Race. Additionally, by the end of this period, the first organized systems of magic were created in Sagobad, ala Hermeticism. The largest player of the growing magic systems was based heavily on cult worship of the dualistic goddess(es) Sashas. This magic was known as Sashism. The ideas of Sashism interplayed heavily with other cult magics, and none were synthesized into a complete corpus yet.

---
***23k - 21.5k BBT - Plane Race***
In the second or third generation of kingdoms and empires that rise after the Red Sun, magic and theology had become developed enough to begin the Plane Race in earnest. The empires central to the Plane Race embody a grandeur analogous to the mid-ADs Roman Empire--a great Classical territory. The key player was the mighty Tanorian Empire, which conquered the Nos Mori kingdoms through the power of its mages. The central city, Tanore, is seated north of Thandairia across the dark Mountains of Fire. Tanorian Sashist monasteries and towers dot the mountains where the Red Wizards carry out their studies and mysterious rituals. Nomenes during this time was not home to only one great Empire--a trade route crossed the Wesaxum mountains and passed south of the Uruvand Traps, following the southern coast of the Sea of Akshah. It passed through the valleys of the Gairian Mountains to reach the growing kingdoms of the Gairian Plateau. All along this route kingdoms and empires sprung up. Language, culture, magic, and goods were all exchanged along this route.

The Plane Race is marked by the conflict between Asfalon and Artifex as they struggle to start (or stop) the advancement of planar Gate magic. Eventually, around 21.5k BBT, Artifex emerges victorious, and planar Gates are opened between the realm of the humans and Asfalon.

The time at the end of the Plane Race sees the creation of written, holistic, systematized magic.

---
***21.5k - 20.5k BBT - Dark Ages***
The opening of the first Gates does not necessarily bode well for the denizens of the world. Human colonization brings social collapse, disease, etc. A dark age spreads across the globe as the world is forever changed. This time ushers in magical, theological, technological, demographic, and philosophical revolutions. Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, etc, spread throughout Asfalon.

---
***20.5k -18.5k BBT - Regrowth, Early Middle Ages***
The world begins to recover around 20.5k BBT, as the first kingdoms and empires harboring extra-planar beings grow. These states give way to a new generation of great empires around 18.5k BBT.

Human and dwarf settlement of Rhunendor.
Settlement of northern sweeps of Austera.
Settlement of Southern Luazil.
Settlement of Azaherem and Gairia.
Settlement of Beaytu and Kuhorik.

---
***18.5k - 16.5k BBT - Rising Empires***
Beginning in a time analogous to the 600's AD and the reign of Justinian I in Constantinople, this is a period of great advancement in all realms of society. This period is often considered to have generated the first "modern" empires. Three global powers dominated the scene:

Heavenly Sinisar Empire, the dominating power of Perakor and the legacy to the old ideals of Krinica. During the colonization at the end of the Plane Race, four huge Gates were opened between Perakor, Southern Luazil, Kuhorik, and the region around Oreus. The Gates went quiet during the Dark Ages, but a magical storm at Oreus suddenly reopened them around 18.5k BBT. Over the next millennium and a half, High-Elven conquests from Perakor swept over the region and built the Heavenly Sinisar Empire, a fractious state that is constantly in a political flux. It is a great melting pot of culture and languages, the first great global empire of the High Elves and the Northern Hemisphere. From their connection to the region of Oreus and the astar there, the Sinisar connects the culture of both histories for the first time.

After the collapse of the Tanorian Empire, many of the Sashist wizards and Tanorian thinkers traveled east along the trans-Nomenes trade roads. They brought the classical knowledge of the Empire to the eastern kingdoms, allowing the East to take over from the West. Two large players grew here, one on either side of the Gairian mountain range. On the west, sitting in the wide grassy hills and valleys between the Sea of Akshah and the mountains, was Oz-Leshah, "Great Leshah", after the capitol city of Leshah, "City in the Mountain Field".

Across the mountain range the whole of the Gairian plateau and beyond was controlled by an empire that styled itself as the continuation of the Tanorian Empire, though it is dynastically ruled by the Guzarwayd line and centered around the capitol of Ejdradad. The Guzarwayd dynasty controlled parts of Ushastadel as well, trading across the cold sea with the Heavenly Sinisar Empire, connecting all of these great states together.

At the height of this period, around 17k BBT during the golden age of these empires, a simifix occurs and Revelation is captured. The simifix leads to some of the largest constructions and great deeds to be passed down to Hykhe's empire.

---
***16.5k - 15k BBT - Crumbling Empires***
The high medieval period is heralded in with 16k BBT, analogous to ~1100s AD. During this time, Decay is killed and the Lineament's cult begins to rise as it seeks revivification. The great learned empires, the Sinisar, Oz-Leshah, and the Guzarwayd Dynasty, decline.  These great empires saw religious revolutions and the creation of new, powerful magic systems. For the first time, spontaneous casting and spell preparation were possible (around 17,240 BBT). Natural philosophy and the study of the physical and aphysical world was beginning.

Universities were formed by 16,040 BBT. A scientific method of experimentation and hypotheses was developed, an instrumental advancement to the creation of the modern magic systems. Milling technology was spreading through the technological centers of the world: windmills, watermills, etc, by 15,680 BBT.

---
##### The Rise of Hykhe
---
***20.5k BBT - Origins***
Just as these great Empires were falling, Hykhe's empire was rising. After the #PlaneRace simifix, several inspired humans were able to open Gates from their formerly fey Shardrealm into Asfalon. One of their chosen locations of immigration was the small land of Rhunendor, where they were heavily influenced by several Lineaments. The humans developed magical societies there, and in the background the Lineaments acted on their own agendas. Creation sought a method of creating new Lineaments for Artifex, and in this quest he captured Grace and extracted from him the essence of his power. Grace was left a husk, a mortal. Though he lost his memory, Grace was subconsciously armed with his knowledge of the nature of the multiverse and magic. He went by the name "Hykhe", meaning "Grace" in the human language of the region. #Hykhe set himself apart as a  wizard-king, growing into a powerful necromancer by 17.5k BBT. He created a state which was revolutionary to those before it in several ways, solving the classic problems of Empire and allowing his mandate to conquer the world as had never been possible before.

---
***17k BBT - Birth of the Shadaean Empire***
Hykhe became king of the city in Rhunendor known as Shada, after the early human word "Shadaqat" meaning "promontory". Shada was built upon a great stone pinnacle overlooking a swift mountain river. Hykhe's early reign was marked by violent and severe war against those kingdoms and cities around Shada.

Hykhe used his powers as a necromancer to command a vast army of undead while he himself shapeshifted into a dragon as black as the dark moon. His command as the fearsome dragon instantiated the dragon insignia that would last until the end of the empire. 

Hykhe conquered the most powerful states of Rhunendor, initiating the early Shadaean Empire. Seeking immortality near the end of his mortal life, Hykhe pursued lichdom in the manner of the ancient Akobe of Nomenes. After he achieved his new-found undeath, Hykhe set out on his most ambitious conquest yet: eastward, across the great sea that separates Rhunendor and Luazil.

---
***16.9k - 16.5k BBT - Expansion***
Hykhe and his undead army crossed over the sea floor, pulling vast rafts of supplies behind them. They reached the shores of the former Sinisar Empire, which, by this time, had crumbled in this region in all but name. The Sinisar state was fractious to begin with, and around this time the Empire was losing control over some of its core regions. Cohesion was minimal, and internal power struggles were tearing the empire apart. The conquest of the Kuhorik was brutal and swift, though Hykhe lacked a way to meaningfully tie his two territories together. Taking inspiration from the ancient Gates of the Sinisar, Hykhe studied Gate magic and began the construction of a Gate system between Kuhorik and Rhunendor.

Around 16.6k BBT, several decades after the completion of the first two Gates, the Shadaean Empire reached a logistical chokepoint. The single, isolated Gate pair was an administrative nightmare. In an ingenious and massively expensive technological, engineering, and magical feat, Hykhe ordered the construction of a multi-city Gate system that would connect the major cities of his conquered lands to his capitol at Shada. The first Gate system was expensive to the point of draining the riches secured during the mighty conquests of Hykhe during his life, and it required the attention of thousands of laborers and mages--notably Hykhe himself to instantiate many of the Gates themselves. Five cities were connected to Shada during this phase.

###### Early Gate System
The construction of the Gate system sent a shock through the young Shadaean Empire. Suddenly, the people of the longstanding city of Shada were pressed next to the people they conquered.
This immediately created cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and theological tensions. While the Shadaean Empire had long controlled all of Rhunendor, the wide territories of the Empire had not been in such close proximity to each other.
1. Differing dialects and languages made it difficult for people to communicate. However, the incredibly multicultural Sinisarians had long been developing a common language in their territories. This tongue, "common Sinisarian", slowly became the lingua franka of the common people of the city, especially over the course of the first century of integration as people moved around the huge interconnected metropolis.
2. A Shadaean sense of ethnic superiority quickly rose in the city, leading to a stark ethnic divide.
3. At the same time as this ethnic gap, the Sinisarian culture carried significant weight. The diverse and luxurious culture had long been attractive to the people of the young Shadaean Empire who had experience with far-off merchants and storytellers. Seeing it firsthand, the connected Shadaean cities quickly began to borrow from Sinisarian culture.
4. The human-borne Shadaean religion met head-on with the complex religion of the Sinisarians. Parts of Sinisarian religion was based on the human religions of Kuhorik, giving the two peoples some common ground to start. The religion of the high elves and the Austeran astar were very different, however.

At the same time that this power and ideological imbalance was acting on the cities, a cultural pressure was also exerting its force. The culture of the Sinisar Empire was one of the most well-regarded of the time; it was exotic and luxurious and complex. 

Common Sinisaric: Alemannic + Serbian + Proto-Semitic + Shughni


Innovations / changes over the course of Empire:
-Undead army
-Gate conquest
-Advanced city sewage infrastructure
-Imperial Cult
-Appointment of sub-rulers
-Building of the Nexus
-Meritocracy and Bureaucracy
-Usurpations
-Misc disasters -- black plague?
-military betrayal?
-Planar unification

Thus, the great Last and First City was born, the name coined over time by visitors knowledgable in ancient human mythology. The Gates were huge archway portals in all the major cities. The Gates made the once-separate cities essentially mono-urban. With this development, every major city became Kalma's capitol. No border was too far to be defended, though all were perhaps too close...

So, in the early times, before it simply became The Empire or The City, Hykhe's Empire was the Shadaean Empire.

**16.5k - 15k BBT** (36th - 51st centuries)
Through this system, Kalma conquered kingdom after kingdom. He toppled empires and folded small cities and states into his realm. Not all were forceful, many came willingling into his control. He grew his great City slowly. Frontier kingdoms often adopted Kalmatic culture as they lived in proximity to the Last and First City. The massive hub was attractive culturally, linguistically, etc. Many states wished to become like the city--until, eventually, the most loyal were added to it. During this period of growth, the Last and First city evolved in many ways. Its culture was syncretic, its language a patchwork of tongues from around the world held together by a slowly evolving "common" language. Growing cultural tensions during this time threatened the cohesion of the city. After Kalma conquered the old crumbling Guzarwayd dynasty of the New Tanorian Empire (*~15.8k*) and the lands of Oz-Leshah (~*15.5k*), the exotic and attractive culture and some of the governing practices spread throughout the City.

The Imperial Cult was established, pushing a new philosophy of unity, self-actualization, life meaning, afterlife, and theology, and the administration was turned into an examination-based meritocracy.
**Dissolution of old aristocracy?**

This also ushered in a new time of magic and learning. The earliest universities were established through the Cycladene Church and the Imperial Cult.

Further, this introduced the Myriad directly into the Last and First City.

A mature City-Empire emerged from this crisis. The meritocracy allowed for upward movement and negated the growing corruption of the old aristocracy. It played well into the new philosophy of life and death pushed by the Imperial Cult. Kalma became a god-emperor, a divine Judge and ruler. Personal action and virtuous nature raised ones status in the eyes of the god-emperor, and after death your body would be venerated through undead service to the Empire and City. The more virtuous your life was judged, the higher rank you would be given in death. Kalma's empire, the City, was revered. Low taxes and prosperity offered by the City gave people a generally happy life. They *wanted* to continue serving the Empire, and they often had an idealized vision of how that service would play out. This was the core cohesive nature of the Imperial Cult. It served both to provide hope, upward movement, and soldiers for the Imperial Machine. 
    During the establishment of the meritocracy, a standardized language of government was established. This was different from the common language. Administrators are well honored, and were often considered to serve in high ranks after death.
    -interesting market: embalming salts, fluids, oils, etc. Fresh smelling chemicals and alchemical concoctions to help the dead look alive. Especially high-ranking dead.

As the Empire and City aged, things continued to evolve and change. The city grew enormous, and it became a myth unto itself. Those within the city often held a simple view of the world: there was the City and the Wilderness. Outside the city the location didn't much matter--the city was everywhere, all at once. Further, the City itself had new life. The Imperial Cult and the idea of the Empire in general became synonymous with the City. The City was the Empire and the City was the God. The City was Kalma, and Kalma was the city. Many people believe that the city is simplify endless. Its size and shape are believed to be controlled by the Emperor-God-City, and the City is often personified in speech, etc.

As LFC grew, sewage became a problem. Empire instated sewage infrastructure reforms (*~15.2 - 15.1k*), reconstructing many gates to have underground sections to help funnel waste into central location - Touchstone.
Otyughs and oozes process waste in underdark, though lake contamination angers aboleths.  
  
Gate reconstructions were absurdly expensive for the Empire, and they came at a time of increasing war (expansion of agricultural zones across Austera). While the Empire's soldiers didn't really need to be payed, the supplies needed to outfit some of the legions, along with the coins needed for bribes and gifts, contributed to the onset of coinage debasement and an economic crisis for the government (*~15k - 14.8k*). Riots and rebellions rose up, and numerous usurpers made attempts at Kalma's throne.
  
Kalma came out victorious, and the crisis led to the minting of a new coinage base, some military reforms, administration reforms, and religious reforms. It was from this middle crisis that the Late Empire emerged more powerful than ever.

(53rd - 55th centuries)
*~14.8k - 14.6k* - Cycladene Church is on top of the Empire. Early Bank of Miros is created under the government and monetary reforms. Construction of Touchstone revolutionizes economy, allowing for a major exchange market and birth of many modern factions. Guilds are organized. Universities are expanded.

55th century
*~14.6k* - Banks mature.

This body ruled that experimental evidence always supersedes theoretical evidence, one of the foundations of modern science.

Naturally, the installing of a panel of experts and the founding of journals also led to genuine [peer review](https://explorable.com/peer-review-process), a process adapted from the Muslim practices.

Scientific Theory, publication of Principia 13400
Military Academies 13280

Another simifix--during which Kalma, as a powerful wizard, unites much of the world with Gate magic. United too to the planes.
    Golden Age of Kalma's Empire is High/Late Medieval, diverse, including elements of the Byzantines and Islamic lands, of exotic other planes, etc. Leads to a sort of cultural homogenization.

=========

Kalma's Empire collapses in 14th millennium BBT, leads to practically global dark age, disease, etc. Black Death? Demonic invasion?
Leads to rise of advanced thought -- Rennaisance drama, Enlightenment writing, Magical / Alchemical revolution, economic modernization, etc. 13th millenium BBT.
