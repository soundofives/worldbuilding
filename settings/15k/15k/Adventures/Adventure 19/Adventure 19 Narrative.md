In the chaos, the Archlord of Coin, Dariush Ishur, was kidnapped. It was obvious that Rabbitouille turned them invisible before going to save Dragana. Their ally Maximo fought off the Myriad agents--but their other ally, Mysto, made an attempt on Dragana's life and was aided by the Myriad cleric.

So...from the outside, whose side is the Crew on? One attempted to kill Dragana, two attempted to save her. Another kidnapped a prominent Bank official and Ishur family member. Possibly--just maybe--the druid was truly attempting to save her.

In any case--the Crew has unknowingly walked into the heart of Ishur-Duskivaine politics. Dariush Ishur was long suspected by the Bank to be a double-agent for the Cycladenes--so getting a chance to question his corpse is invaluable. Dariush is known to be dead at the start of the mission--his clone woke up. His clone is in Shada, though his family is immediately captured by the Ishurs. The Bank and the Shynedar-Kai are on the trail of the Crew, each trying to get to them first.

How to decide who gets to them first?
The Cycladenes? The Bank? Zagyg? Rilan?
Rilan finds them first and lets them know that both the Cycladenes and the Bank are after Dariush's corpse. He warns them not to trust either group.
Adnan is now in bed with the Cycladenes. He feeds his location back to them and betrays the Crew in spectacular fashion.
If the Crew doesn't do anything specific or creative to get themselves to a Bank, then the Cyclades catch up to them due to Adnan's betrayal.

Adnan wants the Crew gone.
The Cycladenes want the Crew dead.
The Bank wants the Crew removed + arrested OR cooperative
Rilan, Yrah, and Zagyg want the Crew alive.
Mordenkainen said he could protect the Crew, but won't harbor blatant fugitives. He's be rid of them, but he'll insist on keeping the Blade to destroy it, and keeping Yrah there.

## IF the Bank catches them first...

>[!quote] Borlaw
>
>Generally here, Borlaw is cautious. He knows the power of the Crew... that's why he stays distant and has a bunch of body guards with him. The Bank generally uses an internal army of undead that they share with the Cycladenes. The Bank wants the Crew's potions, which are doing a great job of controlling the Mercenaries, and eventually the Lawyers. However, the Bank is also an organization that requires discretion. They can't have the Crew acting so chaotically. If the Crew cooperates entirely, ie gives over Dariush's body AND promises not to do anything so horribly rash in the future, Soza Ishur is willing to forgive them and allow them to continue working alongside the Bank. If this is not fulfilled, then the Bank will seek the permanent arrest and imprisonment of the Crew.

Borlaw has 2 Deathlocks (Inspectors of Law) and 3 Slaughter Wights (high Udummu)

- Yes
Are there other worshipers among the Duskivaines?
- Yes
Why would the Duskivaines turn to a demon?
- Need ... edge .... win .... war....

## IF the Cycladenes catch them first...

Fayesh, oldest son of Mirica Mirema and 2 Shynedar-Kai catch up with the Crew and have a chained and masked bodak in tow.

>Fayesh and the Cycladenes are hostile to the Crew--but they do want some explanation as to why the Crew was at the Ball that night, and some clarification as to why they acted kindly to Dragana and the others. Also, why did they kill Dariush?

>If the Crew hands over Dariush's body for destruction, the Cycladenes will let them go. If not, then they attack!

### What else is happening?
Rilan wants to meet up with the Crew. He is an agent of Fraz, and thus he is working to push the narrative of the Cycladenes and Orcus. He reacted to Muck -- . Rilan has just realized that he's met the Crew--but he quickly adapts and works to pitch the Crew on their final job:

Dismantle the Cycladene church, once and for all.
What are some steps for this, generally?
- Take out leadership
- Disenchant public to their beliefs
- Defeat Orcus

Fraz is also threatened by Mordenkainen. He can't allow Mordenkainen to study him--and he can't allow Mordenkainen to destroy the Thief Blade. His only option is to take out Mordenkainen. He can either plan the long game and set up an assault of the Obsidian Citadel by the Cycladenes, or he can do the job now. He is technically still in the Tower--but he can leave briefly to take care of the Obsidian Citadel... or He sets up the assault of the Obsidian Citadel by the Cycladenes.

Why wouldn't Orcus attack Fraz as soon as he leaves the Tower?
a - he doesn't know. This seems most likely, as he can't be scried on...Once the Obsidian Citadel is destroyed, though, Orcus will know something is up.

Perhaps Zagyg was there! Yrah blames the whole thing on Zagyg and his allies.

Adnan wants the Black Blade--and he's so obsessed with money and selling Maximo's new battalion plan that he's tempted to off Maximo and take the plan for himself. But he steels himself and realizes that if he can take this Blade, he can have all the power he wants. So, Adnan wants to attack Zagyg and the Tower. This makes him a target as an ally of Orcus. This is partly why the Cycladenes so eagerly wanted to meet with him. They have recruited him as a worshiper of Orcus--secretly.

The Cycladenes trace the Crew back to the Obsidian Citadel, where they infiltrate it.

A clandestine meeting with Borlaw and a Bank necromancer -- a "mind scraper", Cirus?? -- they want to question the corpse of Dariush Ishur, who they have long suspected to be a Cycladene double agent.
Dariush, like all archlords, has a Clone that was created when he took up his position. Now that the Bank has had the opportunity to question his corpse and reveal his betrayal, they can effectively predict the Clone's motivations and control him.
The Crew's actions need to be explained. The Bank understands that, generally, they would be expected to either stand by or  They also now have the opportunity to infiltrate the Cycladenes themselves....

Dariush Ishur was alive, awaiting his position as undead. Those in positions like this have clones to safeguard their saved position. So Dariush is not really in any danger here--except there is now a race between the Cycladenes and the Bank to acquire and destroy his corpse.
The Bank thinks the Crew is too volatile to be left active -- they need to be taken out. Even better, arrested.
The Cycladenes believe the Crew were definitely acting to attack them, but had to pivot to save face when they realized they were inadequate.
Yrah is afraid that Mordenkainen and Eres will discover a way to destroy the Thief Blade -- so he takes them out.
Yrah has made his move against the Cycladenes -- he sees that the Crew has chosen them as their favoured enemy, so he and Rilan are beginning to work to take Cycladene hearts and plant agents of Orcus. Rilan / Yrah will give the Crew their final job : dismantle the Cycladene cult once and for all.
