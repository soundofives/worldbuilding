It's time for Milo to take her Apprentice Exam. She's in the business of seeking power and protection: she wants a Warrior spirit. She's done research over the last few months tracking down the tomb of a powerful warrior, a human champion from the Kuhorik region during their fight against the Heavenly Sinisar Empire. The champion, **Larom**, lived around 18,215 BBT, or around the end of the 18th century of the Empire. He lived in an area near modern Bonz, and his tomb is rumored to exist in a cliffside cave just outside where the fishery district has expanded to. The tomb can only be accessed easily at high tide, which, at this time of year, will happen at night.

Scenes:
- Reaching the Tomb (climbing down the cliffside, taking a boat, etc)
- Entering / Passing the puzzle at the entrance
- Escape during the flood through shark infested waters!
- The confrontation in the entrance hall--the Shynedar Kai block the exit 

#### Scene 1: Reaching the Tomb
Milo knows that the tomb should be situated a certain distance north of Bonz at the seaside, but doesn't know the exact location. The tomb is situated at the low-tide line of a rocky sea cliff. Even at low tide, about a foot of water covers the floor of the entrance cave. The Crew can climb down the cliff to reach the tomb (what the Shynedar-Kai do) or find a boat ride to get there.
#### Scene 2: Door Puzzle
 The entrance is a stone door that can be pushed open only at high tide. If it is opened, water begins to pour in and flood the tomb. If the Crew goes during the day (low tide), they'll be able to find the entrance cave and the stone door. The door is inscribed in old Kuhorik: **"Step to the doorway at the low, when the fish are far below, but until the fish swim far above, the door is locked no matter the shove"**
#### Scene 3: The Tomb
The tomb itself is not very extensive, but the Crew needs to rush (skill challenge!) in order to get to the burial chamber and back before being completely submerged. To make things even harder, the area is infested with reef sharks that get pulled into the tomb as it floods!

Skills that help:
Attack - fend off the sharks
Investigation / Perception / Insight : find secret passages, listen to echoes of the water crashing around
Nature: smell the fresh air / feel the wind to get back out
Acrobatics / Athletics, jump over flooded parts to avoid sharks

At 3 successes, you have gotten to the burial chamber and Milo grabbed the **sword of Larom**.

A failure will resort in a little bit of damage from the sharks and a notice that the water is high now, almost at their waists--at 2 failures, the Crew is submerged and will be taking more damage! They'll have only a few minutes to get out. Stakes are high! At 3 failures, they all must swim to the surface, and it takes 6 - # successes minutes. For each minute beyond your max (CON mod), you have to make a CON save of DC 12,14,16. On a failure, drop to 1 hp. On a second failure, you go unconscious and start drowning.

#### Scene 4: The Ambush

Waiting for you when you make it out of the flooding back parts of the tomb are four Shynedar-Kai led by the same one you fought before--a huge scar across his chest from where Maximo cut him. This is Milo's family, her cousin Luvomas. The others are a witch named Dragana and two warriors named Vesna and Zetlana.

Twists: the Shynedar-Kai are back!
- 1 Witch
- 1 Paladin
- 2 Shadowdancers
Strategy: Split into pairs and focus on one PC at a time.
The Witch + Shadowdancer pair: Witch attacks with her blackfire strike, trying to curse as many people as possible around her. She has to be in melee range, so to get out of melee ranger her Shadowdancer tries to use his chain to pull PCs away from her.
The Paladin vows an Oath of Emnity and focuses on that person, using getting Sneak Attack bonuses to damage. He'll save his Divine Smite for someone other than his Oathbearer. His shadowdancer will focus on keeping the Paladin safe by distracting anyone else around him, restraining them, knocking them prone, etc.

All with the shadow jump ability will use that to escape melee range--in general, they try to attack from 10 ft away, then shadow jump and move to 40 ft away. The enemy will have to dash to catch up to them, but won't be able to attack. Then the Shynedar-Kai will just repeat the process. If someone does get into melee range and attack them, the Shynedar-Kai will Shadow Jump out to 10 ft away, then attack with their chain and rely on regular movement to get out of range. If the attacker has a torch, the Shynedar-Kai can't get out of melee range without provoking an AoO. They'll use one attack to shove the enemy away, then escape. If they can't shove, they'll just suffer the AoO.

They might be dealing quite a bit with fighting *restrained* condition. They'll use Shadow Jump to get out if possible, but if they're in bright light then they have to get out manually, which is its whole action (if it goes the DEX route, or just a shove if it goes the STR route. They're not super strong, so they'll probably go the DEX route). If it manages to escape, it will wait until its ally tries to move the troublesome creature away from it, allowing it to escape without taking an AoO. If the battle control fails or if there's no nearby ally, the Shynedar-Kai will just suffer the AoO and get away.

The Shynedar-Kai can only teleport in dim light and darkness. Bright light makes PCs vulnerable to the Beshadowed Mind curse from the Witch, so if the Shynedar-Kai needs to escape from someone and they're cursed then they try to attack and knock them prone, giving them disadvantage on the AoO.

The Witch is surrounded by 15 ft of difficult terrain, meaning it takes 30 ft of movement to get to her from that range. She'll use this to her advantage, trapping people and slowing them down.

Generally:
The Witch will try to hit people who just took damage from the Shadowdancers to negate their next healing opportunity.
The Shadowdancers will start the combat jumping around and staying mobile. If things start to get hairy, they'll tag team people and focus them to death. This is when Luvomas uses his vow of emnity and hunter's mark. He'll have Shield of Faith on from the start, dropping the Shield in order to get the extra damage.

The water will be rising quickly in the main chamber. At first, only about a foot of water fills the room. The fighting can happen on the ground in the ruined house. After Round 1, the ground becomes difficult terrain.
After Round 2, the water is approaching waist deep! Sharks are swimming through it, causing damage every turn. The Shynedar-Kai move to balance on the ruined walls of the house. The Lower Tier is flooded. 
After Round 3, the water is 5 ft high
After Round 4, the water is 8 ft high and pushing at the top of the ruined walls. Middle tier is flooded.
After Round 5,
