Hasur Highfallow has been kidnapped. The thugs who did this, a small street gang called the Young Devils, delivered a note to the Tower via a courier, Karim Rightlegs.

The Young Devils are a small, unimportant group of thugs trying to make some quick cash through a basic and mostly unplanned kidnapping scheme. They plan to lure the ransom delivery to an abandoned plaza on the outskirts of Touchstone and ambush the delivery, taking the cash and extorting further from the delivery. During this, they've decided to hide Hasur Highfallow away in the inner sanctum of a nearby "abandoned" church of the Cycladene.

Unluckily for the Young Devils, the Shynedar-Kai noticed them setting up camp in the abandoned chapel. The desecration of holy ground (the inner sanctum) immediately marked them (and, unfortunately, their victim) for death. The Shynedar-Kai will work to slaughter the Young Devils. (Only worshipers of the Cycladenes are allowed into the inner sanctum for worship)

The Note:

"We have captured your acquaintance who calls himself Hasur Highfallow. To buy his freedom, bring 300 gold to Tree-knot Plaza in front of the abandoned church five streets from the Silver Pass Gate, towards the Cerulean Arch. Do not come armed. -The Young Devils"

-Milo wants to join the PCs on this one!

**The Young Devils**

The thug group has been growing lately around the Silver Pass Gate, mugging people and stealing from docked canal boats. They are generally just a nuisance, though they've been growing bolder.

The leader, Azi Dearborne, goes by Big Azi. Second in command is Little Lina.

Some ways to gather info on the Young Devils:
1. People around that area will be discontented and will offer up whatever help they can.
2. Guards will offer 2 helpers if presented with a compelling case--but it will cost the PCs 40 gold--20 for each.
3. A former associate of Azi's, Tomlaw Rashan, works as a server at a local tavern now, the Busty Crow. He'll offer up a lot of info on Azi and the plot.
