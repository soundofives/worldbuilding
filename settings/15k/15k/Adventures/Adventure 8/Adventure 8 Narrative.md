>[!summary] Overview:
>Pick up after Rabbitouille's resurrection in Sinisa's winter. Introduce the city as a living place a bit more and lead with the lack-luster effects of Mysto's hard work as a bioterrorist.
>Mysto is inducted into the Grove of Obad Hai, and they task him with stopping an imminent attack by the Children of Erythnul before they cause the whole LFC to turn on the druids.


## Scene 1 - Intro
*The air is crisp and cold. Flags flutter in the courtyard of the Tower and along the streets of Sinisa as people celebrate the Weaver's Festival. The paths and roads are muddy and wet, and the alleys and country hills are thick with snow. People bustle through the streets, bundled in coats as they buy preparations for their winter feasts. The Tower has been alight with festival cheer--the wizards are used to tragedy and loss. It's part of the profession. So, despite the loss of several students through the year, new arrivals have brought rising spirits and hopes.*

*Kataena Stok, a yellow-skinned Tiefling from Dragon's Rook. Her family are wealthy planar merchants.*
*her brother, Mory Stok, a cheery boy eager to learn magic.*

*Over the last year, the Tower has almost started to feel like home--but you've all been busy. Cooking potions, dealing with merchants and bankers and businessmen. Mysto's nights have been spent fervently carrying out bioterrorist acts against the city--but with little lasting success. You walk through the streets and find that every tree you plant is now a stump feeding the fires of the cold houses of the city. The cobblestones, cracked from the roots and vines are replaced. The walls, crumbling from heavy vines are propped up and repaired.*

## Scene 2 - Mysto's Induction

*About a week before this, Mysto was out in the Grove of Obad Hai. The last year has been hard--you've been allowed barely any sleep as you mix potions in the day and cavort with the druids at night. Finally it's paid off.*

*The Circle of Obad Hai claims grounds around a small lake only a few hours beyond the walls of Sinisa. The forest around "The Lake" is **alive**, teeming with life. It is untouched by industry and the tools of civilization. Animals prance and stalk the trees and the druids learn from them and peacefully live amongst them. Oak, birch, and ash trees circle the lake in serene bliss. To one side of the lake is a high craggy hill where the Circle carries out its sacred rites. Small huts are set on the hill, but no wall surrounds them and the trees grow up it until the soil gets too thin to harbor them. It is crowned by a circle of standing stones, each carved in the likeness of an animal. It is here that the druids of Obad Hai gather and carry out a ritual under the new moon to welcome you to their Grove. No torches are lit--the circle is lit only by the pale light of the stars which are so important to the Circle. The stars are reflections of the earth, the animals and natural things. Their cycles and constellations tell the stories of the Grove and the Groves that came before it. The ritual is festive and energetic, music from the druid's flutes and drums fill the cold air. Half of the druids in attendance are in the forms of animals, flying, chittering, and snorting with the music. The ritual is presided by the Arch Druid, an ancient and gaunt high elf named Liana. After ritual, song, and a precession to the lakeside, she transforms into a beautiful celestial chimera with the heads of a horned lion, horse, and eagle. Her fur is a brilliant glowing white like the stars above. She welcomes you to the Circle, telephathically speaking to all around:*

>[!quote] 
>**"Mysto--you have proved yourself to our Circle. You are loyal, proud, and have the strength of Obad Hai in your heart. This night is your celebration, though I have more to speak to you about. A darkness has been creeping outward from the Children of Erythnul. The beasts have been growing more frenzied, and we have learned of their plan to strike at the Loggers Guildhall. Their strike will set the city afire with fury, and it will ruin whatever relations might remain between the people and the druids. You must stop them, or our Grove will be in even more danger than it already is. Death and massacre is not the path to our victory, but they do not understand this. Use your allies, and carry the warmth of Obad Hai with you. The stars say the attack will happen on the last day of the Winter Feast."**

Give the Crew some time to prep and plan what they want to do.

## Inspector Jeffers

1. an Inspector comes after the Crew
	1. One of the Young Devils was the deviant son of an aristocrat (son, Danoris Marin, mother Liliana)--they refuse to believe the kid was actually a part of the gang. Rather, they believe he was kidnapped. The people that slaughtered them all should face the penalty of murder: hanging until dead.
	2. Further, the Duskivaines frame them for the arson of various churches. Jeffer's doesn't reveal this one at first. He wants to play the long game--first he'll see if they turn themselves in. His job is to convict them of a crime infront of the judges. This takes evidence--even circumstantial evidence--especially for mercenaries who are understood to walk the line of law and crime.


What they tell Jeffers: 

## Logging Guild

There are about 1250 each of woodcarvers and wood sellers, each under the umbrella of the logging guild along with the thousands of lumberjacks and cheap laborers they employ in a top-down marketing scheme. They monopolize essentially the entire wood business.

With ~2500 workers making ~60 gp / month, there is a total of around 1.8 million gold flowing through the wood industry every year. With 10% going to general guild dues, that is 180,000 each year going to the guild. Much of this is used, with the Guild able to save about 1% per year (1800 gp.) Over time, this builds up and accrues interest. With the industry growth in the last 20 years, they build up a stockpile of 50,000 gold in their treasury, which is held by the Banking Guild in their Dragon's Rook vault.

The current High Artisan position is held by Zayd Vukoff, a high elf with deep blue skin.

## Children of Erythnul

The Children of Erythnul are run by a **warlord** that deposed the previous leader a few years ago. The new chief is a human man named ***Karn***. The Children conduct bloody rituals and sacrifices of people they kidnap to the god Erythnul. In their minds, Erythnul is the god of power and the **Animal Heart--the Beast**. He is hungry and dark, and he controls their minds and hearts when they give themselves to the Beast. He is not quite like the Myriad interpretation of him.

The Children will not attack the Crew on site. They'll listen to them, and try to recruit their help in taking out the Guild Hall.

The attack force is run by a thug named Garim. He's a violent beast who has a burning, blinding hatred that fuels him.

## The Greysouls

The Greysouls are a hidden faction of druids that try to bridge the gap between the Children and the Circle. They use both the Heart of the Beast (they are lycanthropes) but also believe in the peaceful mastery and path of the Circle of Obad Hai. They are rare and are oftentimes not accepted fully by either group. They strive to unify the two groups by focusing on what they both care about: the stars, constellations, etc.

They are Circle of Stars druids, and are very rare! They also have some benefits from both Groves (minor lycanthropy, some advanced wildshape)

THe Greysouls are the most ancient Druid Circle, and are technically more related to the ancient druids native to the Krinica region than the animal druids that came in from forced relocation. The only significant Greysoul in the city is Moryes Lullak, the hermit that lives on the edge of the city in F2.

If Mysto is on his way to **kill**/**aid** the werewolves at the Loggers Guildhall, Moryes finds him and approaches in the guise of a homeless man, telling him that senseless killing (of the wolves / of the loggers) will only bring retribution onto the Circle of Obad Hai.

"Killing the Guild Masters will only anger the Guild. They are wealthy and powerful, will men lining up to replace the High Artisan. They'll strike back and they'll strike hard. You'll start an all-out war that the Druids cannot win."

"Killing the wolves will only serve to distract both Groves from the true enemy. The Children of Erythnul will strike back while the Guild continues to clear your forests."
