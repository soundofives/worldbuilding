Zagyg must behave as if Yrah is still away. He plays the part of the insane, worried father. If asked, he'll admit to imprisoning his son so that he can never run away again. He deludedly believes Yrah is still away--possibly captured by the Crew who want to kill him with the Blade to steal his power--and he wants to keep him safe. In any case, Zagyg must play the part of the insane parent with no understandable motivation.

Fraz has propped up the Cycladenes as a key enemy. He's gotten the Crew to hate them already, and they're pretty focused on that front. The Crew freed him from his prison and brought with them the Black Blade. Above everything else, Fraz needs the Crew to keep their autonomy. At this point, Yrah doesn't need Zagyg to chase the Crew. He's already back in the Tower and has the Black Blade. Now he just needs them to focus on the Cycladenes and eventually get moved towards Tasha, who can help them defeat Orcus.
Yrah wants to build the sense that Zagyg is after the Crew. He wants to stand Zagyg up as an enemy

# Leomund's Hidden Lodge

Monster House!

The doorway is posted with guard signs warning of entry; a bystander says that no-one who goes in ever comes out!

Upon entry:

>[!quote] Monster House
>*"Are you Leomund, greatest wizard of the Circle of Eight?"*
>A: No, as Leomund is not the greatest wizard in the Circle of Eight.

Traps, happenings

>[!warning] House Dangers
>Rotating walls that separate PCs
>Banisters on stairs grapple PCs
>Mimics!
>Furnace / hearth sends out smoke!
>Spew sewer bile! Acid Damage
>Rugs
>Glyph of warding (5d8)

Generally, this house uses the House Hunter Mimic stats. It locks the Crew in and tries to kill them with Mimics. If they best the Mimics, it would turn towards its own digestion.

If any of the Sentimental Items are found, the Lodge will try to attack that person--but save the item. The Lodge has a Prismatic Engine at its core (a room that can be reached from a few halls in the cellar, but has reverse gravity from all sides pointing towards the center) that is the only thing that can destroy the sentimental items -- they are protected by powerful warding magic.

2. **Arcane Disruption:** As a magical entity, the Lodge may be sensitive to disruptions in magical energies or wards. Finding and exploiting weaknesses in its magical defenses could weaken its ability to spawn Mimics or control its surroundings, leaving it vulnerable to attack.
	- Dispel Magic can stun the House for 1d4 rounds!
1. **Physical Vulnerabilities:** Despite its formidable defenses, the Lodge may have physical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by skilled adventurers. Identifying and targeting weak points in its structure or composition could weaken its overall integrity and make it easier to defeat.
	1. The Lodge's physical structure can be attacked, but it can't really be killed
