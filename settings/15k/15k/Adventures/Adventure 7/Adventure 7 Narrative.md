Rabbitouille is dead--for now. The Crew can cast Raise Dead, but Rabbitouille's soul is being devoured by his Curse. If too long passes (1 year), the Curse will destroy his soul forever.

Raise Dead is heavily controlled by the Bureau-mancers. Getting their hands on a scroll can be difficult: they might have to go through Black Market corridors. The Thieves Guild will have access to it, and a meeting could be arranged at Shadowmark Alley. The scroll is worth 500 gp, and the Thief will only agree to sell it for 1000 gp. He'll start at 1500 gp bartering. Handing off a large sum of money like that should be done in a safe environment --  a single representative is to meet at the Cloaked Courtyard, unarmed.


The spell Yrah knows to soul-delve is 7th level.


Challenges in Rabbitouille's soul:
Throughout each of these challenges, the Crew has to keep Rabbitouille's Spell Book intact. It represents his power--his life force, his soul. They must take it through his Soul, avoiding Rabbitouille's taboos and completing some challenges related to his life. At the end, they confront his Curse. Upon defeating it, Rabbitouille's soul is free to be revived. The Spell Book can be read to better understand Rabbitouille's life and give clues for each challenge. First off, it gives hints at the Taboos:


>[!info] Things that can damage the book:
>1. Water - a river must be crossed!
>2. Fire - jets of fire spurt from a volcanic terrain, endangering the book!
>3. Attack! - Skeletons will often attempt to target the book instead of a person

**Taboos:**
>[!info] The Spellbook's notes:
>Rabbitouille was raised by a harsh family that drilled certain instincts into him from birth. Even in death, his soul will retaliate if these taboos are broken:
>1. The Library is spotless--make a mess and provoke the Curse!
>2. Books are precious--allow any of them to be damaged and provoke the Curse!

**Challenges:**

1. Endure Rabbitouille's rejection. Everything you know is gone--you're left with nothing.  

1. Rabbitouille's Rejection - putting yourself in new bodies
>[!info] The Spellbook's notes
>Rabbitouille was rejected from his family and cursed. You must enjure his rejection too.

>[!warning] Rejection Challenge:
>Recover the Spellbook from Penis Breath. After recovery, 

1. Trapped in new skin - mix up! Everyone turns into a random animal and they have to fight a few weak skeletons
>[!info] New Forms:
>1. Badger
>2. Bat
>3. Rat
>4. Cat
>5. Crab
>6. Deer
>7. Pony
>8. Weasel
>9. Owl
>10. Goat
>11. Lizard
>12. Mastiff

steal something / infiltrate something / return it to the Spellbook!
Get an ingredient for the Spellbook. Steal something from Penis Breath!
-The Spellbook gets taken by Penis Breath and needs to be recovered to show them the way through the memory.
Penis Breath can accidentally light the stack on fire!

Next: A series of riddle rooms!
-With incorrect guesses, bad stuff begins to happen. Water slowly rises (1 ft per wrong guess for Pony scenario, 6 inches for all small animals), bugs fly around and try to eat the book's pages (attack rolls to defend / CON save to take the bugs ire), fire spurts out of the walls or floor or something (DEX save)
1. I have a head of gold, I have a tail of gold--but I have no body. What am I? - Coin
2. I am not alive, but I grow. Without air, I die--but I do not breathe. What am I? - Fire
3. Two men drink poisoned Iced Tea. One man drinks his fast and lives. The other man drinks his slow and dies. How is this possible? - poisoned ice
4. I am so fragile, that speaking my name will break me. What am I? - SIlence
5. What am I? - Riddle
6. I am brought to the table, cut, and served--but never eaten. What am I? - Cards

Each correct riddle slowly turns the Crew back to normal! One body part at a time.

After these riddles are solved, the Crew confronts the Curse!

Ok so some quick thoughts I had on the flight: All revivication spells state that the target's soul must be "free and willing" to return. A soul that is "free and willing" is more an exception than the rule. Almost all revivication will require a quest of some sort to free the soul from whatever has claimed it after death--deities, devils, demons, angels, etc. In Rabbitouille's case, his essence is being devoured by his Curse. The Crew will have to find a way to delve into Rabbitouille's soul and free him from the Curse (controlled by you)

"Delving into Rabbitouille's soul" could basically mean they have a whole dungeon/adventure area themed on what goes on deep in Rabbitouille's mind/subconscious

Raise Dead is the only practically used spell to return the dead to life, and it doesn't do a good job. It creates a sentient undead akin to a bureaucrat.
