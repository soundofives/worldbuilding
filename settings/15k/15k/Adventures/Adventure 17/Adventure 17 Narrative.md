The Crew killed Survyastra! They claimed they threw the Blade into the lava. When this comes to light, Zagyg is furious, has Gurak the planar scholar gith summon an invisible stalker, which reveals that the sword is not on this plane.
Zagyg also says that this place is under the influence of a demon, and they cannot stay long. They must do a quick and efficient search and investigation. The fact that the Blade is not on this plane means there must be some sort of magical interference.

### Questioning

What happened to the sword?  
Describe the events that led to it falling in the lava?  
Who threw the blade in lava?  
Was the Blade retrieved from the lava?  
Did anyone touch it before it was lost?  
How was this dealt with?  
Are you or any of the Crew under the influence of the Blade?  
Are you or any of the Crew under beguiling magical influence?  
Are you or any of the Crew under external pressures that would lead them to steal the Blade?  
Did you see the Blade leave this plane of existence?  
  
----If the Crew questions the legitimacy of the sword:  
Describe the Blade, how it was used, and how it was different from a mundane blade.

### Other Reactions to the Blade:

Yrah: Yrah wants the sword to stay in his possession, so he suggests the Crew hand it over to Zagyg. Whatever the wizard's intentions with the sword--Yrah doesn't think his father will do anything evil with it.
Mordenkainen: Mordenkainen is influenced by his secret consort, Eres. She despises the Blade and wants it (and all of Bash's influence) destroyed.
The Blade can only be shattered or destroyed if its connection to Bash is temporarily severed. In a battle of wills, they must channel their own potential into the thread of Onsinta to confront Bash in Andolem. This allows the Cord of Onsinta to be loosened. Then, if Bash's psyche can no longer support it, the Blade can be unwound in the Ethereal Plane at the altar of Corilya. This will remove the cord of Corilya and Onsinta.


### Back in the City
How has the City changed over the last two months?
Shynedar backs loggers, logging increased due to influx of funds and mercenary protection bands
Barricades set up around Sinisa to protect against new Merc battalion org
Bank eager to addict all mercs and lawyers
Jeffers watching the warehouse, working with Shynedar and alchemists to book Crew on child murder charges. Jeffers has gone to cave , not found any evidence left of fight there
Jeffers is waiting to take the lawyer Hasur Highfallow into custody to question him about the child murdering event. Jeffers went to and entered the Sunken Cave, but there was no evidence remaining of the supposed crime.
He spoke to the courier of the message who had rumor that Hasur was kidnapped; so he wants to check. Hasur would have first-hand evidence of the murder, but he's the Tower's lawyer and will defend the Crew.


### What next?

I want to Crew to start coming to the realization of the Demon War, and that a Demon Lord is at large and might be influencing things behind the scenes.
Key conclusions to make:
- The Crew is being groomed.

- Fraz appears as Yrah, who shares a past with Muck.
- ***Mordenkainen shares that Yrah and Muck traveled to the Abyss 215 years ago.***
- Muck has memory flashbacks that reveal actions taken that help Fraz.
**Conclusion** - Muck is being controlled and groomed by Fraz.
