One large arc is the story of Zagyg, Tasha, Fraz, Vecna, and the Abyss.

Fraz Urb'luu is in a showdown with Orcus, Grazzt, and the other Demon Lords, and the Emperor, Zagyg, Tasha, and the Crew are his tools. Against all odds, he is trying to reclaim his place as Ruler of the Abyss.
His plan, already underway:
1. Create an Empire and a great army under his influence.
2. Hide himself away in a fortress for protection against Orcus.
3. Imprison Orcus's allies in the Demonomicon.
4. Groom the Crew to act as a scalpel to capture Orcus.
5. Use the Thief Blade to kill Orcus and take the power of the Last Word.
6. With the Last Word in his possession, his foes imprisoned or dead, and the Empire under his control, he will conquer the Planescape.
Fraz controls the world from behind the scenes by ripping out his victims hearts and permanently dominating them--or by manipulating them into an equally binding slavery. Millennia ago, he tricked the newly-mortal Hykhe into summoning him. Fraz captured the Candle King's heart and dominated him, guiding him as the Shadaean Empire grew in its conquests. Over centuries of Domination, Hykhe grew into the dark wizard Vecna. 215 years ago, Yrah, son of the wizard Zagyg, found Fraz's Tome of Zyx and learned of a false plot: Orcus was going to try to invade the Prime Material. Yrah traveled to the Abyss but fell into Fraz's trap and was Dominated. Fraz used Yrah to blackmail Zagyg and his wife, Tasha: do exactly as he said, and Yrah would be safe. Zagyg summoned Fraz to the Prime Material in the moments before Orcus and his demonic alliance of Demogorgon and Grazzt invaded Fraz' realm of Hollow's Heart. In Zagyg's "prison", Fraz shared abyssal secrets to his false captors, guiding Tasha to create an object of Fraz's insidious design: the Demonomicon, constructed around the Abyssal Staff. Tasha was tasked with summoning and imprisoning Orcus's allies within the book, which she has faithfully done. Zagyg was to protect Fraz at all costs. If anyone learns about Fraz's identity or even his presence, it could mean the death of Yrah.

A fateful prophecy by the nascent pre-Cycladenes arose and gave a hint to stopping Fraz's plan. Fraz twisted the prophecy to his benefit. He began to spread the interpretation that Orcus was planning to invade the Prime Material, recover the Black Blade, kill the Emperor, and destroy the Demonomicon--the most powerful weapon against demonkind. This deception is his the guiding hand behind his deception to the Crew: they must stop Orcus before he carries out his fell plot.

>[!warning] Prophecy
>*A scene of the Candle Crown hewn by a shadowy greatsword,*
>**In the grasp of the Deepness Gloam, the Candle King a Black Blade mourns,**
>*A flashing scene of a tome, hands reaching toward it as it flips open, the vision spiraling into it.*
>**Blade Black as the Unhallowed Tome, Six by six by six its pages shorn, fate unwound to the hollow bone.**
>Interpretation: The Emperor is controlled by the Abyss. If the Emperor is killed [by the Thief Blade], the Demonomicon (Vecna's phylactery) can be destroyed.

What of Fraz's plan has yet to unfold:
Tasha will continue to pull Demon Lords into the Demonomicon until the Crew is powerful enough to confront Orcus. If he can be captured, then at that moment of ultimate weakness Fraz will come forward and kill him with the Thief Blade. At this point, his ultimate goal has been achieved, and he will be the ultimate power in the Planescape with few rivals. He will steal the Demonomicon and sequester it in Hollow's Heart, forever trapping his enemies away.

The context:
The Last and First City, heart of the Shadaean Empire, is embroiled in an underground civil war between the Duskivaines and the Ishurs, the two great families that control the Cycladene Church and the Bank of Miros. They are tightly woven into the Bureaucracy, the Criminal Underground, and the war between the Cycladenes and the Myriad. Almost all social tension and threads of control can be traced back to one of these two families interlocked in a centuries-long chess game for power.

**Other goals and motivations**

*Vecna*
Vecna has been searching for a way to be free of Fraz for millennia. For this endless time he's learned all the darkest arts--and created more. He has raised an army of evil and concocted the most vile of all spells. He has become the first arcane Lich, tied to his master's Demonomicon. Still he searches for a way to be free--though he knows lichdom alone will not solve it. Only by recovering his Heart can he be free, and only by the wills of Fraz himself or using the power of the Abyssal Staff can he enter the Library of Hearts. The Abyssal Staff can only be recovered if he is killed--a sacrifice he is willing to make if his killer will free his Heart from Fraz's Realm. He can only hope to make a deal with those that confront him: he must fight them under the Domination of Fraz, but he begs them to recover his Heart from Fraz.
Vecna is dominated and ordered not to betray Fraz.

*Tasha*
Handling the Demonomicon and spending hundreds of years studying the Abyss has corrupted Tasha to the point of no return--but only to that point. She stole the Demonomicon and ran off with it in order to keep her demonic powers away from civilization. For over a century she committed atrocities as the Witch Queen of Perrenland, Natasha the Dark, Iggwilv, Hura of Ket, and other names. She first summoned Grazzt, thinking she could coerce him into aiding her in defeating the other Demon Lords. In this she was right, but she ended up falling in love with her prisoner--and he with his captor. She was alienated from Zagyg, though there was not much of his former self left. Tasha and Grazzt's relationship brought down Demogorgon and several other demon lords, even weakening Orcus himself. But, in a moment of weakness--perhaps intentionally--Grazzt was able to escape. He imprisons her for a time in Azzagrat, but she is freed. She sets up Prismeer, where she continues her work of imprisoning the last of Fraz's enemies. Above it all, what poisoned her and Grazzt's relationship was her unwavering secrecy about Fraz and the motivations behind her hunt. She will maintain this secrecy to any end, for the sake of saving her son.

*Zagyg*
The Mad Wizard has perhaps gotten the worst end of Fraz's deceptions. Tasked with guarding the King of Demons, Zagyg's constant presence around Fraz led to a permanent mental injunction with Hollow's Heart that has driven him into a deep insanity. Besides his insanity, though, it has given him the deepest understanding of the Prince of Deception's realm.

*Grazzt*
He simultaneously loves and hates Tasha--and he'll do anything to help her defeat Fraz. He wants to see the Demonomicon destroyed--after all, it's a powerful weapon against him. He also wants to see all of Fraz's plots unravel before his eyes. For now, though, he still needs to uncover Fraz's plots.

*Guire, Eres, and Bash*
Guire works to preserve life and fight for Asfalon, so he wants to help the Crew if they fight for good. He is the Aspect God Haere. He, as the enigmatic patron of the land, protects the PCs in disasters and on journeys.
Eres wants to return and become the most powerful person, master of all realms and the arcane. An old manifestation of her, Sashas, is returning in a Renaissance of magical learning. Despite this, she also created the Aurhal Autochthon of Cathorin. Eres worked with Vecna to develop dark magic, but she also acts as the patron and consort to Mordenkainen, as he is very likeminded with her.
Bash hates Eres and Guire and Selor. He wants to corrupt everything they do, and if that means destroying all life--so be it. He, through the Thief Blade, will push the user towards slaughtering Orcus and allowing the demonic invasion to occur. He wants to see Vecna killed, Mordenkainen killed, all of them.

*Mordenkainen*
Orcus's "plot" has been known to Mordenkainen for some time--at least since Yrah and Muck and Serten went to the Abyss. However, Mordenkainen didn't act then and he won't act now, at least not for the "good of the world". He believes that magic of his power must remain neutral. He is so arrogant that be believes himself to be a god-like force. However, he is secretly in love with Tasha and will act to protect or save her. Of course, canonically, Mordenkainen changes his ways and places himself as the ultimate arbiter, exiling Vecna and all of Touchstone.

*Bank of Miros*
Fraz knows that the significance of history and conflict forges heroes. He wanted to raise the conflict in the Empire to spur on the generation of the Crew, the great heroes that would kill Orcus for him. So, long ago, he stole the heart of Kasra Ishur and prompted him to split from the Duskivaines and grow the Bank of Miros. Fraz has been nudging the Bank this whole time as they started the religious war.
They, however, don't necessarily know this. To them, they are just a Bank:
If the world gets invaded by a demon horde, people will be less inclined to pay back their loans. This is unacceptable. If Orcus is planning to invade--he must be stopped. This Fraz guy? Whatever. Killing the Emperor? This would destabilize the government (in reality it will be so much worse), unacceptable. Eventually, the Bank might realize that the world is fucked. It goes into emergency mode: liquidate all assets. Close on all loans immediatly. Distribute magic items between its branches to use when it sets up de-facto local governments after the Empire collapses. Move on wholesale take overs, i.e. of the Incantators to monopolize magical powers for a possible warlord state.

*Orcus*
The Master of Death doesn't particularly want to invade the Prime Material plane. Sure, he wants all things dead and under his control eventually, but right now he's in a showdown against Fraz--not against the whole world yet. He is weakened, and so he is focusing on his revivification and finding his Wand. He's working primarily through the Cycladene Church, the upper eschelons of which are filled with his worshipers. This was, subtly, supported by Fraz's manipulations. Orcus gives power to the Duskivaines and receives power from them as well. Nystul and others are working on reforming Orcus's wand. Once he accomplishes these two things, then he'll make a move against Fraz himself. He is constantly watching for Fraz and waiting for signs of him to emerge. He tracked him to the Tower, but realized that he is far too well protected there to be attacked. When Fraz left the Tower and went to Mordenkainen in the Obsidian Citadel, Orcus saw it as an opportunity to strike at his enemy. Orcus entreats with Lolth to learn what he can about Fraz, and he tries to head Fraz off with his Cult if he can.

A - Orcus / Cycladenes strike at Obsidian Citadel
B - Fraz strikes at Obsidian Citadel
- right now, nobody knows that Yrah / Fraz left the Tower. Certainly not Orcus and the Cycladenes. Or would they?
C - Both? After the kidnapping of Dariush Ishur, the Cycladenes investigate and track the Crew. They infiltrate the Obsidian Citadel and find Yrah, prompting them to attack it under orders of Orcus. Publicly, this is warranted because Mordenkainen is harboring high fugitives of the law. Privately, this is to attack the Crew and Yrah. Yrah / Fraz takes this assault as an opportunity to get rid of Mordenkainen.

**Questions**

*How do you destroy the Demonomicon?*
The book was made essentially indestructible: its base, the Tome of Zyx, served as the phylactery to Vecna's soul. With its expansion into the Demonomicon, it could only be destroyed if six powerful demons who had escaped its pages each rent one sixth of the book within the six days that Vecna's body was destroyed before its rejuvenation.

*How does Fraz's domination work?*
The spell Dominate Person beguiles someone--it charms them into believing themselves to be Dominated. Fraz Urb'luu skips the middleman and simply dominates the target. So, no charm-ending effect could interfere with Fraz's domination.

*Why didn't Fraz dominate Zagyg and Tasha?*
Fraz realizes that dominating them would completely remove any ounce of deniability he has in his identity. Simply leveraging their son is, in a way, a more fool-proof plan.

*How does Fraz react to an attempted escape plot?*
Well, seeing as Zagyg's Tower is the safest place for Fraz to be, he doesn't really want to go anywhere--but he'll relish the opportunity to throw off Muck. He'll pretend to escape, all the while really sending a Rakshasa body double while he remains in the Tower. He was the one who brought the Crew down there in the first place to begin grooming them, but he wasn't counting on their stupidity in mentioning his imprisonment to Mordenkainen. If all goes well, the Crew will believe him rescued and Zagyg will continue to believe him imprisoned. If Zagyg believes that he failed in his task and thinks the real Yrah is in danger, he may snap.

*Why don't Tasha and Zagyg destroy the Demonomicon, recover the Staff, and free their son?*
Destroying the Demonomicon isn't that easy. It would take killing the Emperor and freeing all the demons that **despise** Tasha, fighting them off and taking the Staff for themselves--all without Fraz stopping them.

*What will Fraz do if his deceptions unravel and he is confronted?*
He'll first try to use a manipulative line to strike fear into the hearts of those that uncovered him: "Me? A demon? I ..." he feigns domination, "I'm controlled by one. What are the symptoms of demonic presence: creeping darkness. Check. Abyssal plants. Check. Insanity. Check. Why do you think Tasha left and started studying demonology? So she could exorcise the demon from her husband's soul. Why do you think I'm imprisoned down here? Why has he threatened to kill anyone who finds out about me? Because I'm the only one that could recognize him for a demon besides Tasha. Zagyg is Tower's demon!"

Or..."You're right. I'm a demon. But...I am not imprisoned here. This is a fortress I have constructed for my own safety. My home in the Abyss was attacked by Orcus, Demogorgon, and Grazzt. I escaped, and came here to work towards their downfall. Orcus is plotting to open a new Blood Rift to the Prime Material Plane, which would allow all of demonkind to flood into your City. I aim to stop him from achieving those goals."
If these partial deceptions don't stop hostilities towards Fraz, he'll next try to contain the leakage by assassinating anyone who knows about it with his rakshasas and shadows. If that fails and his identity becomes widely known (or at least known widely enough to get to Grazzt), he leaves his prison and leaves a powerful illusory/shapeshifted double. He himself will go and use all the leverage he's built up to hamstring the powerful forces of the Empire (Mordenkainen, Zagyg, then Tasha). The Emperor will move on Prismeer and forcefully take the Demonomicon. Together, the Emperor and Fraz will use the Demonomicon to bind six Demon Lords. Once they do, they'll recover the Staff and attempt to move on Orcus.

*What events led up to Fraz and Orcus's rivalry?*
Uncounted years past, Fraz grew in power during the Second Abyssal Civil War that tore through the plane after the essentia of Mycelia and the Forges of Creation were devoured. At the time, the Pale Night ruled all the Abyss from Hollow's Heart wielding the powerful **Hollow Staff**. Fraz used the essentia he captured to create the **Last Word**, a vile curse, which he laid upon the Pale Night. The Last Word is a gossamer veil that covers the cursed being, destroying the demon and transforming it into an ephemeral power without ambition or consciousness. When Pale Night was cursed, Fraz stole the Hollow Staff and used it to divide the Abyss into two great Pillars connected by web-like bridge Realms. For millennia, Fraz ruled both Abyssal Pillars and grew more and more powerful. During his reign the Abyss began its injunction on the Three-Fold Glooms, and the first Tenari are created. Eventually, essentia from the Silent Halls and the Labyrinth form in the Infinite Fear and a Third Abyssal Civil War rages. Fraz's rule is challenged by the young Orcus, who claims the essentia and forges them into his namesake **Wand of Orcus**. Seeing the power of Orcus, Fraz sacrifices much of his control by branching the Abyss a second time, creating the Third Pillar. Orcus is satisfied for now, but the new Tenari demons are more ambitious and vile than ever, and the Abyss becomes steeped in internal conflict.
Eventually, as the history of the Last Nousant played out, Vanemer emerged into the planescape and created the Astral Web, connecting all the planes and opening the Heaven's Gate between the Abyss and Avernus. The Blood War begins, offering a means for demons to rise quickly to prominence or fall violently into ruin. The Blood War waxes and wanes, recently waning as a Fourth Abyssal Civil War wracks the plane with conflict. New essentia had formed within the Infinite Fear, and the greatest Demon Lords vied for the power they offered. Orcus sought another means of increasing his strength and sealing his superiority over Fraz: he hunted down the lost Pale Night, enveloped by the Last Word. He attempted to bargain with the former Queen of Demons and win her over to his army, but she tricked him and ripped his soul away from his body, devouring it and assimilating it unto herself. The Last Word possessed Orcus's body, but the Master of Death was not so easily defeated. His soul battled with the Pale Night and regained a delicate dominance. He bested the Pale Night and controlled the Last Word, though its presence beside his soul began to slowly degraded his being. Orcus now controlled two great artifacts: his Wand, and the Last Word. Orcus resents the trap laid by the Pale Night, and he seeks to quickly claim the Abyss for himself before freeing himself of the unhallowed power of the Last Word, or at least cure himself of its debilitating effects. With the Last Word under his control, he formed a demonic alliance with Demogorgon and Grazzt and made an advance on Fraz's domain of Hollow's Heart.

*How did Yrah end up imprisoned?*
Zagyg was a part of one of the earliest wizarding groups in the Last and First City after the rise of magical education and the construction of Touchstone. He and his Company of Seven explored the Planescape--in fact, they were some of the earliest to do so. In their travels, they came face-to-face with some of the horrors of the Abyss and its inevitable march towards the Prime Material. They recover the Abyssal Tome of Zyx (written by Fraz himself and filled with deceptive rituals), which is inset with a shard of the Abyss itself to keep the tome forever up to date in its information. Zagyg and his partner, Tasha, have a beloved son: Yrah. Yrah joins an adventuring group of his own, the Circle of Eight. Yrah, always curious and mischievous, steals the Tome of Zyx from his parents and discovers within its pages a false plot by Orcus to invade the Prime Material. In his youthful zeal, Yrah and his friends enter the Abyss to confront Orcus. They fall into Fraz's trap, instead being teleported to Hollow's Heart and dominated by the King of Demons. Fraz makes a deal with Zagyg--that Zagyg would imprison Fraz and protect him, projecting a guise of forceful suppression. In return, Fraz would protect Yrah. And so the deal was made, and Zagyg and Tasha came under the influence of Fraz Urb'luu. On the very day that Orcus and his demonic alliance invaded Hollow's Heart, Zagyg summoned Fraz to the Prime Material and imprisoned him. Fraz disappeared from the Abyss in the blink of an eye.

*What happened in the Abyss after Fraz vanished?*
With the capture of Fraz, the demon hordes were handed off to Demogorgon, Grazzt, and the other Lords. The Fourth Abyssal Civil War exploded into furious slaughter. It took them some time to discover the existence of the Demonomicon: only when it is used by Tasha to bind Grazzt do the Demon Lords really take it seriously. Tasha used and manipulated Grazzt, and through him Tasha orchestrated a play on the most powerful Lords of the Abyss. An attack on Orcus himself was first, using Demogorgon and the powerful drow Kiaransalee as weapons. The attempted assassination brought Orcus low, destroying his body. The Master of Death rose as a great shade, and he unveiled the power of the Last Word, instantly killing Kiaransalee and weakening Demogorgon. In his weakened state, Orcus retreated to the depths of his Realm to recover his Wand, which was lost in the attack. With Orcus temporarily out of the picture, Grazzt worked with Tasha against Demogorgon. Together they bound him in the Demonomicon and *imprisoned* the book in a demiplane so as to never let Demogorgon possess Tasha. In this momentary success, Grazzt escaped, but his freedom came at the cost of one century in Azzagrat. Grazzt changed in the clutches of Tasha--he loved her, and he hated it. In his imprisonment he learned that much of what Tasha knew--or at least what got her started--was given to her by Fraz. Finally, the King of Demons had resurfaced. But where? Grazzt plotted against Fraz and worked towards his own freedom. As he was being pulled back into the Abyss, Grazzt dragged Tasha with him, binding her in an Abyssal demiplane for a time before she was rescued by the demon-wizard Tuerny. In his freedom, Grazzt is focused on trying to find Fraz and control, or destroy, Tasha's Demonomicon.

*What was Tasha's timeline?*
 Over the last 200 years, Tasha worked to understand the Abyss and its denizens better than anyone else. She discovered the true names of many of Fraz's enemies and how to summon them, and she bound many of the most powerful demon lords within the pages of the Dark Tome.
215 Years ago - Tasha and Zagyg write parts of Demonomicon
185 Years ago - Tasha is corrupted and runs off. Witch queen of Perennland, when she summons Grazzt.
160 Years ago - She summons and binds Grazzt to learn more. Demonomicon is expanded. She binds Tsojcanth, spawn of Fraz, a half-fiend.
155 Years ago - Tasha and Grazzt plot against Orcus, weakening him into Tenebrous.
150 Years ago - Tasha and Grazzt plot against Demogorgon, which ends with Demogorgon captured, but an Abyssal injunction that was created could only be closed by binding Tsojcanth to it. This was done, but allowed Grazzt to escape.
150 Years ago - Grazzt is freed, Tasha is imprisoned
50 Years ago - Tasha is freed by Teurny in exchange for her help in destroying Grazzt. Tasha agreed, though she doesn't really want to confront Grazzt again. They're like icy-hot.
50 Years ago - Tasha founds Prismeer.

*How does Muck play into all this?*
Muck is the pin that binds Fraz to the Crew. Muck is the key to the Crew's grooming, and in fact is the reason that they are the Crew at all. Fraz has deep knowledge behind the metaphysics of the Planescape. What he learned he learned from Infinity the Perpetuant. The most important point is that Fraz has a basic understanding of simifixes and the importance of history. He knew that his plans would result in a simifix--in fact, he counted on it. He needs a simifix to raise heroes of the caliber of defeating Orcus. Muck is the seed of those heroes, and a seed that Fraz can control. He sent Muck away just before the sack of Hollow's Heart with the eventual goal of returning to the Prime Material plane to join the mercenary group that would discover Fraz and become the heroes to defeat Orcus. Muck served as the seed for many of Fraz's props: the Orcus cult in Stardale.

He wants to build their trust. Sending the Crew deeper into Muck's story will reveal that Muck can be controlled--and that he was likely controlled by Fraz.
Things to be revealed about Muck's story:
1. His heart was ripped out by Fraz.
2. He is controlled by Fraz.
3. Hollow's Heart was sacked by an alliance headed by Orcus
4. Muck and Yrah were sent away before this.
5. ??

*What's the canon ending?*
Fraz's plots are uncovered by Mordenkainen and the Circle of Eight, who first move against his servant: Vecna. They fail when Fraz intervenes. The vampire lord Kas is destroyed after he uses the Thief Blade recovered by Zagyg to sever the hand and eye of Vecna. Halmadar, servant of Vecna, kills the archmages of the Circle of Eight, save Mordenkainen, who exiles Vecna and Touchstone to the plane of Ravenloft before escaping himself into the Planescape. The Empire collapses. Zagyg and Tasha confront Fraz and destroy the Demonomicon, freeing Fraz's enemies in order to defeat him. In the chaos, Zagyg is killed and Tasha uses the Abyssal Staff to infiltrate Hollow's Heart and free Yrah and Vecna's Hearts. Tasha tries to hide away, but, after a short crisis, the demons are banished back to the Abyss by heroes led by Yrah using the Crook of Roa.

*What would be the Crew's "best good guy ending?"*
The good guy endings really rely on whether or not they want to try to free Yrah and Fraz's other slaves. This would require them destroying the Demonomicon and releasing the Lords of the Abyss to fight another day.
Alternatively, they go for the "greater good" scenario. They kill Fraz or imprison him in the Demonomicon along with the other Demons and hide them away, ridding the world of their scourge. If Fraz isn't on the same plane of existence as the Emperor, then he can't exercise his domination--then, to finish the job, they could kill the Emperor. This part is more optional, but the Emperor will try to destroy the Demonomicon if he can--so he'll have to be subdued.

*What's the best "bad guy" ending?*
They help Fraz or Orcus. Fraz's ultimate goal is to gain ultimate power and control the Planescape. His rule will not be very nice. Orcus doesn't even want control. He simply wants everything dead, and thus, under his domination. Helping either of these two Demon Lords will lead to a pretty evil ending.

*Why haven't Zagyg or Tasha wished Yrah free?*
Wish, as a spell, has not yet been written. It needs to be discovered. Perhaps the Crew can do this.

--
Orcus needs to be more active here. The Crew needs to care about his threat--they have to want to kill him.
Fraz has introduced the idea that Orcus is manipulating the Cycladenes. How can he double down on this?

Yrah goes all in -- he tells the Crew that Zagyg is a demon closely tied to Orcus and was keeping him there because he was the only one who knew.
He had to get away from the Shadows, because the Shadows could report to the Emperor who is also in cahoots with demons.
