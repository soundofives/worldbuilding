Last time, I advanced the Veliu story by having Lord Samir Veliu captured by Cailana and Naz. Rather than coercing the Veliu's to distribute their goods; they had blackmailed them and threatened them with the life of Samir. The syndicate member, Zara Bakalli, is still important for the distribution of the potions. She moves the potions between gates on behalf of the Hauling Guild.

The dinner party gave the Veliu's the opportunity to slip the message to Carric that they were being held captive. However, the Helmed Horrors reported this back to Cailana, who has just left her warehouse (and Samir) with Naz. Cailana is heading to the Veliu's to enchant/charm the young ones and capture the matriarch, like Samir, and likely bring them both to Dorthyza in his Isle of Dreams.

-- Adventure 26 outcome : the Crew freed the Veliu's from their capture and forshadowed harassment by Cailana. They killed many of the guards and the archers, and the Veliu's (sans Kami, who was killed), escape into a safehouse and task the Crew with freeing the patriarch Samir.

Where I want this to go: eventually, I want to draw them in to Tasha and reveal much about the plot (Fraz). This will let them choose their ending: kill the Cycladenes and take down Orcus, or help Orcus and take out Fraz. Or both!

- Introduce Cailana + her connection to Solodovnika. If they return her to Solodovnika, the Fey Queen will tell them anything they want to know, including where Prismeer went. OR... if they don't take the bait (or before they enter the Astral Plane in the first place), Jeffers tells them. Jeffers is actually Kalma. He is working for Fraz, but he doesn't want to be. He wants Fraz to fall, but he cannot speak against him or betray him -- it is the manner of his domination. 

Cailana first tries to curtail and control the Veliu's. She wants to make them pay for their betrayal. She will head towards the Veliu manor by way of the cliffs above the house, roping down onto rocky ledges from above.
will try to buy the business off the party for 20,000 gp. If they refuse, then she
