### The Current State
---
What's been *insinuated* so far about the wider plot?
- Orcus is weaving some plot. He's got worshippers within the Cycladene Church, who attacked the Crew at the Grand Revelry
- Demon Lords are vanishing, starting with the original Demon King, leaving only Orcus left to rule the Abyss. (Uzaxuk, rising Demon Lord)
- The Thief Blade is prophesied to be a danger to the Emperor; Zagyg seems to want this weapon.
- Learning more about demons and their motivations will require seeking out Prismeer and its master: Tasha.

What's been insinuated so far about the narrower arc?
- Dorthyza, a beholder, is behind the Green Magic potions. He employed Cailana and Naz Bahar. He lives in the Isle of Dreams in the Astral Plane.

What part do other groups have to play?
**Bank:** The Bank worked to escalate the Myriad x Cycladene conflict via an investment in the budding military-industrial complex. They are invested both in military industry (mining and weapons production) and the mercenary companies employed by the aggressors. Faced with a ceasefire, the Bank will react by trying to sabotage peace talks. In the meantime, they will opportunistically switch positions and use the demonic threat as new leverage to bolster the defenses of the city. This means supporting Carric, but trying to control the situation as well. Perhaps they try to move the Uzaxuk cults out into the wilderness for now.
**Brother's Company:** The Brother's Company's corrupt council is headed by Valandor Sef, a rakshasa working for Fraz to sew discord within the city. He doesn't want the war to pause.
**The Cycladenes:** The Old Cycladenes want to get control of the Brother's Company by swaying the leadership to their side. They want to support Elara the Giantess and see if they can swing Maximo to their side. If Adnan was willing to support the Cycladenes, then Maximo might too. While Maximo is marked for death by Shynedar, the Schism gives the church an excuse to forgive old sins. Control of the Brother's Company would give the Cycladenes 

What's happening right now in the plot that's hidden?
- Orcus's motivations to track down Fraz and the Thief Blade. He gifted his cult his Sceptre, a weapon to turn the tide of the war. Orcus believes that Fraz is making his way to Tasha, possibly with the Thief Blade, but this is an unknown. The Crew may have still have it.
	- Orcus was using Mahin to get close to Rabbitouille to see if the Crew had the Blade. She died before she could get an answer, but Rabbitouille has been roped into Orcus's grasp himself.
- Fraz's motivations to seek revenge on Tasha and Zagyg + acquire the Demonomicon to trap Orcus.

>[!success] What happened
>Orcus's cult has begun their false purge, dividing the Cycladene Church and culling the cult's power in order to preserve the secrecy of Kas and the highest members of the cult.
>
>Karthain was assassinated by the Cycladenes, giving Maximo an opening in the Guild Council to leverage more control. They gave dirt on Gadovan as well (worshiper of the Elder Evils, and a fey of Bleakwood)

#### Orcus
Orcus will try to use Rabbitouille to figure out where the Thief Blade is. As of right now, he sees Rabbitouille as an enemy token that he's temporarily gotten control over. He doesn't reveal his full plan yet, until he knows for sure that Rabbitouille can be controlled. Also, he doesn't know for sure if Rabbitouille is being manipulated by Fraz -- he doesn't want to reveal too much if all his plans are going to get back to his enemy. Orcus will offer his typical things -- power, eternal life, return of lost loved ones, etc, in exchange for knowledge. He will give Rabbitouille the use of Orcus's Wand if Rabbitouille tells him where the Thief Blade is -- Insight check is +12. If the location is revealed, Orcus will be suspicious -- Fraz wouldn't let the Thief Blade far from his reach. Orcus will ask about Yrah, who he believes is separated and on his way to Tasha. This in itself is bad -- if Fraz gets to Tasha and recovers his Staff, Orcus is doomed. That's why he sent Zagyg to hunt down Fraz so vehemently. If Fraz isn't actually as close to Tasha, it gives Orcus and Zagyg more time to prepare for his approach.

#### Fraz
Fraz get's a hint that Rabbitouille has the Wand of Orcus -- he tries to talk Rabbitouille out of using it, leveraging his trust as a patron. If this doesn't work, Fraz is the one to pull strings and call in the Planetars and Orthons to kill Rabbitouille + Carric and recover the Wand of Orcus.
At the same time, Fraz is trying to get the Crew to move towards Tasha and Zagyg to help him kill them. He won't necessarily introduce his enmity, instead he'll use them as a means of getting him into Tasha + Zagyg's presence so that he can spring his trap and kill them on his own -- **the moment of glorious betrayal**.

>[!warning] What next
>Fraz pushes the Crew towards Tasha + Zagyg.
>Fraz talks to Rabbitouille, warning him against Orcus's manipulations and lies -- "he'll try to turn you against your allies until you're all alone."
>Orcus will try to get Rabbitouille to tell him about the Thief Blade + Yrah.
