### The Current State
---
What's been *insinuated* so far about the wider plot?
- Orcus is weaving some plot. He's got worshippers within the Cycladene Church. (corpse of Dariush Ishur, spy)
- Demon Lords are vanishing, starting with the original Demon King, leaving only Orcus left to rule the Abyss. (Uzaxuk, rising Demon Lord)
- The Thief Blade is prophesied to be a danger to the Emperor; Zagyg seems to want this weapon.
- Learning more about demons and their motivations will require seeking out Prismeer and its master: Tasha.

What's been insinuated so far about the narrower arc?
- A figure named Dorthyza is behind the Green Magic potions. He employed Cailana and Naz Bahar. He lives in the Isle of Dreams in the Astral Plane.

What part do other groups have to play?
**Bank:** The Bank worked in some shadowy way to escalate the Myriad x Cycladene conflict via an investment in the budding military-industrial complex. They are invested both in military industry (mining and weapons production) and the mercenary companies employed by the aggressors. This should be revealed, as to give Carric a chance to increase his role after knowing more.
**Brother's Company:** The Brother's Company's corrupt council is headed by Valandor Sef, a rakshasa working for Fraz to sew discord within the city. He wants to 

What's happening right now in the plot that's hidden?
- Orcus's motivations to track down Fraz and the Thief Blade. He gifted his cult his Sceptre, a weapon to turn the tide of the war. Orcus believes that Fraz is making his way to Tasha, possibly with the Thief Blade, but this is an unknown. The Crew may have still have it.
- Fraz's motivations to seek revenge on Tasha and Zagyg + acquire the Demonomicon to trap Orcus.

>[!warning] What next

>Orcus's cult connection was revealed at the Ball and by the words of Dariush Ishur, a double agent between the Bank and the Cycladenes. In order to keep Khas's stance safe, he needs to take a lead in purging the false Cycladenes from the church's ranks. This will cull Orcus's cult's power, but it will ensure that Khas remains within the Emperor's trust. This purge needs to be public and grand. It needs to show that any evil within the ranks of the Cycladenes is gone and the strength of the Cycladenes is stalwart. If the Thesmata-Kai can emerge in defense of the Myriad ceremonies, it would be even better as an act of an olive branch to the Myriad (which, because they are manipulated by Fraz, they would not take on their own). This is also an  opportunity to extend an olive branch to the Crew -- a false one to gain information. Rilan would come forward -- already a double agent, 

This should vault the plot with the Cycladenes forward by introducing their schism and focusing the Crew's attention on the Orcus side of things. It also gives the Crew an intereseting choice: finish off all the Cycladenes (when the Myriad refuses to recognize any good Cycladene) during the Schism because theyve been weakened, or call for a peace (which the Myriad will push against AND the Brother's Company would push against). The Schism can give the Cycladenes an excuse to forgive old sins, allowing the Crew to receive aid from them once again. The Cycladenes can't forgive the use of unintelligent undead (or any undead that are raised rather than transformed), though, so Rabbitouille is still off the table.

Further, the True Cycladenes want to get control of the Brother's Company by swaying the leadership to their side. They want to support Elara the Giantess and see if they can swing Maximo to their side. If Adnan was willing to support the Cycladenes, then Maximo might too. While Maximo is marked for death by Shynedar, the Schism gives the church an excuse to forgive old sins. How can the Church aid Maximo? The Bank has control over most of his ambitions. The Cycladenes could simply help him get Valandor Sef and the others out of the way -- this would give him greater control over the Brother's Company overall. They can assassinate Karthain (he was ex-Cycladene and marked for death anyway) and give Maximo dirt on Gadovan (he's a fey of Beakwood who worships elder evils). They can't touch Valandor, though -- he's too good.

How does Shynedar react to her worshipers being converted to Orcus? Gods are distant -- they appear in visions, grant magical powers to their worshipers, and have their will communicated through their prophets in order to be accomplished. They can retract their gifts, can influence some disasters related to their domain, or can sponsor champions -- but they can't just smite people down unless that's part of what they do. Also, the powers of other gods can interfere with the anger of another. In the Last and First City, the balance of the Myriad and the Cycladenes tends to prevent one god massively swaying the City in any way. Shynedar aligns her worshipers against Orcus and grants them the Rook, but that's all.
