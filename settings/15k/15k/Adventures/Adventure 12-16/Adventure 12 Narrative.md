*The last great queen of the Tanorian Empire, Suryastra the Great, was corrupted by the Thief Blade and cast down as Suryastra the Blasphemer. Her champions could not defeat her, so they buried her and sealed her away with her greatest treasures: the Thief Blade, her wealth, and her family. The champions stood watch over her prison for five millennia, awaiting the fated heroes that could destroy her once and for all. The years have not been kind on them. Should anyone come seeking her, they must test their mettle, their devotion, their ability to resist the temptation of the Blade, and their conviction--but not in the ways the Champions originally intended!*

The Emperor, in his studies, came across mention of the resting place of the Mausoleum of the Last Warqueen, who was said to carry a black blade of ineffable power into battle with her foes. The Mausoleum is perched high on a ridge of the Wesaxum mountains, buried by millennia of ash.

*The rulers of the classical Tanorian Empire were of the ancient stock of Thandairia--vampires. They are immortal, growing old and sealing themselves into rich mausoleums in the traditions of their people. There, they rest for millennia, sealed within their tombs. The youngest of them occasionally awake, waiting to be fed by their servants who have long died. These poor beings decay in mind and body, filled with a bloodthirst that tears them apart. They descend into a thrall-like mindless state, wandering their tombs and entering intermittent periods of hibernation. The older and more powerful of the vampires will hibernate for millennia at a time, keeping much of their considerable strength for the day that their worshipers inevitably return.*

*The Tanorian Empire was a great and powerful state, but it was their own mages that opened the first planar Gates and doomed the world to a Dark Age. The Empire collapsed, and their great works fell to ruin. Now all that remains are the sealed mausoleums of their ruling houses, buried by millennia of soot and ash from the unending eruptions of Uruvand.*

*Suryastra's Mausoleum remained active for centuries after her entombment. It was used by a powerful Red Warlock, Harmanand, who summoned and bound the glabrezu Uzaxuk in the forges. Uzaxuk's imprisonment has brought on a full injunction with the Infinite Fear, though the greatest part of the injunction has been sealed away within his prison. The Shadows of the Mausoleum still deepen, and the plants twist and rot.*

# Tier 0 - Intro
## Scene A - Arrival in Kathore, Mountain Trek

Aftermath of the dragon attack: one mage was killed, Isidra Stagridge. There were plenty of injuries that need treating.

*The Tower began to pass overland a few hours ago, the thick coastal jungles flying beneath you. The mountains ahead are low, but imposing. The shifting light of the Fires of Uruvand silhouette them, even in the day. Saamy, sitting with each of you as you eat your lunch on the Tower steps, points out towards a distant ridge.*

>[!quote] Saamy
>*"There, up on that ridge! Those ruins--that's where we're heading, I think."*

*The Tower comes down in the forested hills at the bottom of the mountain, in a small village called Kathore. The Tower sits on the outskirts while Taforayesh and Lirael went to barter with the locals, hiring them to help with the excavation. You stay the night in the village while a team of locals packs for the journey and readies their pack chals (chalicothereums).*

>[!info] Vampire Cult in Kathore
>Kathore is home to a traditional cult that services the Mausoleum of Suryastra. They provide semi-regular sacrifices (which maintain the Bloodstarved and the few Vampries within the ruins) and try to stop outsiders from interfering.
>When Zagyg and the Tower roll in, the cult realizes that they can't stop the mages immediatly--but they can perform an ancient Cryptic Tanorian ritual of disaster calling forth the eruption of the mountain to try to stop the excavation.

## Scene B - Discovery of the Site

Hidden entrances:
1. Grove of the Rotroots with hidden lava tubes to Forge or Embalming Chamber
3. Ridgetop Altar (revealed over 3 days, DC 20 religion check to interpret)
4. Great Gate of Suryastra (revealed over 10 days, the ritual is triggered too, good for entrance if ritual is NOT taken part by the Crew. The Gate collapses from an earthquake once they enter.)

## Scene C - Excavation

#### Handling the rest of the Tower:
Most of the mages are going to be focused on scholarship. They are translating uncovered slabs, scrolls, items, etc. This occupies the younger scholars (Zoran Silvergleam, the Regalwoods, Klialtloth, new students  They are attended by Dariush the Quiet and Lirael Stormcaller and Poppy of the Summer Court.)

Soroush and Gurak are attending Zagyg in his primary studies, dealing with the undead, planar magics, etc. Vezel, Dusan, and Mirol stay at the Tower. Zorica Starstorm stays at the Tower too.

Others that can help with the exploration or might be encountered:
**Saamy**
Twig of the Summer Court (servant of Fraz)
1. Two Hands, a pale-skinned elf shadow monk, extreme worshipper of the Sashas.
2. Saida the Bloody, a young girl barbarian. Bloodthirsty bitch.
3. Wael Honorweaver, a mid 30's human bard, a poet of insults and crudeness.
4. Mott, a Tiefling rogue mercenary captain

Useful spirits: **Ritavash, a Red Warlock from the Dark Ages after the fall of Tanor**, spirit of Naz the Poor. **Bahula, a Tanorian witch**, spirit of Vezel Mossvale, who stays back at the Tower and takes accounts of recovered artifacts.
>Ritavash can give accounts of the Fall and the Tanorian Empire. He was a Red Warlock, a practicing mage from Eyasol. He can reveal the radiant resistance and necrotic vulnerability: **"The Rulers, sethakath, were said to sway even their most furious enemies with a glance, turning them on their allies. They were the greatest warriors--nearly impossible to kill, but god-fearing and weak to salt and blessed wooden stakes.**
>
>Bahula can reveal, **The sethakath were the bridges between life and death--their servants reveled in their own sacrifice and embalming, and the sethakath would drink their blood, feast upon their flesh, and devour the very souls of those they killed, allowing them to pass unto the bridge of their own blood to the goddess, Sashas. The blood would nurture the vampire--though upon passing through their lips it became a vile and most powerful poison.**
>
>ALSO, they can reveal basic **Tanorian Chant of passage:** 
>_Jalastra Suvaha, Vayukrida Suvaha,_ _Sashas Sukham Bhavatu._


#### Challenge
The Cultists of Survyastra are trying to secretely carry out their ritual, which is awakening guardian spirits, traps, causing structural damage to the site, etc. Also, some relics are uncovered that need deciphering!
Success: they complete the excavation before the ritual is carried out: 7 successes, 3 failures. On failure: the ritual begins on the ridgetop. On 6 successes--a final prompt to allow the PCs to uncover the impending ritual.

Unprompted:
Unprompted skillables (possible): perception, investigation, history (stoneworking), religion, survival, nature
1. Basic "help the excavation / find secret entrances" checks.
	Scouting can reveal the Rotroot Grove, but it requires closer inspection... (invest, percep, suvival, nature, arcana, stoneworking... DC 18), Ridgetop Altar (Religion, Stoneworking, DC 20, immediately triggers the ritual as the cultists flock).

One check can be to actually help the dig. A success will uncover a magic item:
**Stone of Good Luck** - +1 to Ability Checks and Saving Throws.

Prompted:
Prompted skillables: arcana, religion, history, athletics, acrobatics, medicine, survival)
2. Decipher the artifact (arcana, religion, history, **DC 18**, detect magic lowers to **DC 15**). Artifact is some type of Key Stone -- a cinnabar crystal studded with 300 gp worth of diamonds. It's given to Mott after deciphering (can be recovered later on!)
3. Tremors destabilize parts of the excavation site: wooden structures are beginning to fall and endangering workers and mages. (STR, Acrobatics, Medicine, Survival, **DC 15**)
4. Vampiric whispers corrupt the minds of Zorica Starstorm (tiefling bard) and Soroush (human necromancer). They loudly bicker and argue, and it's beginning to ruin the morale of the excavation (Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception, Arcana, Religion, **DC 18**).
5. Taforayesh approaches you and says that the village workers gather near the mountain top altar for some local holiday celebration--get them back to work! (**DC 15** Charisma reveals that the locals want the Crew to be a part of their ritual. They say they will bring them good fortune--and give them a boon for exploring the Mausoleum. The locals each mildly prick their finger and spread the blood on a stone. They pass it around, eventually it gets to the Crew. Zoran Silvergleam is up there too. **DC 20** religion will reveal the ritual chants, as will speaking Cryptic Tanorian.)
	1. IF the Crew pricks their fingers...all good. Mott and his Crew do NOT prick their fingers; they try to find another way in. Eventually, they are able to infiltrate in through the Rotroots. This allows for the **Betrayal by Two Hands** later on when they meet up.
	2. IF the Crew doesn't prick their fingers, Mott and his Crew do. Two Hands the Shadow Monk is a fanatic and a traitor here--he knows what the villagers are doing, and he wants to help them.

##### The Ritual
>[!bug] Ritual foes
>20x cultists, 1x Chosen.
>**Round 1.** The Chosen immediately charms everyone with temp HP (**DC 17 Wis** for mass charm). 1. then the cultists drag Zoran up to the alter. Other cultists block and slow the Crew.
>**Round 2.** the Chosen spends 1 action reciting the incantation:
>_Vidyu takra, Dharmana arat,_ _SASHAS parakshas, Varshinik ranthas!_
>...which causes the beginnings of an earthquake and volcanic eruption. 
>The cultists continue to block movement, each attempting to grapple (+4) instead of deal damage.
>**Round 3**. the Chosen speaks the final incantation,
>_Ishani hemal, Yojan antaray,_ _Tani rakshas, Utkar SASHAS._
>If able, he brings a knife down and kills Zoran, teleporting all the cultists and the Chosen himself down into the Sacrificial Chamber, blurring everyone into unconciousness. The Crew awakes in the Chamber of Bloodletting. Vampires are feeding on the cultists around them, but there's no sign of the Chosen and some of the other cultists.
>
>Even on a failure, the PCs get 2000 xp per.
>>[!success] XP
>>2000 per
>
##### Success
If the PCs find an alternate entrance before the Ritual is complete, they are free to explore it.
>[!success] XP
>2000 per

Mott and the others will stay behind and get caught in the ritual!
If the ritual occurs, the young Zoran Silvergleam is sacrificed. Mott and the other Mercs are caught in it and teleported down, along with young Mory Stok, into the **Sacrifice Chamber**.
This happens on the 10th day, triggering a **Natural Disaster** in the caves.

# Tier 1 - Into the Ruins
This part can take a while. Let them explore at their own speed, and allow short and long rests--but use wandering monster rules! The Mausoleum is expansive--make the descriptions of travel show that each area is somewhat isolated and has travel time in between the encounters.

Goals of Tier 1:
- Exploration!
- Collect the 5 Key Stones (cinnabar crystals encrusted with 300gp worth of diamonds) to get to Tier 2. 
There are 5 Key Stones.
1 uncovered in the dig (search, originally from a gate guard -- are you strong enough to beat Suryastra?) (given by Mott to Mory or Saamy)
1 in the Sacrifice Chamber (puzzle, Archlich Warden's Test of Devotion -- what is your allegiance?)
1 in the Embalming Chamber (stealth or combat, Trial of Sacrifice -- are you truly willing to accept the consequences?)
1 in the Forge, protected by Uzaxuk (puzzle, mini-quest The Forgemaster's original trial was the forging of Acheron weapons to defeat Suryastra. Now, Uzaxuk is simply trying to escape)
1 in Harmanand's Chamber, (Harmanand's test of temptation)

## Scene J - The Nexus.

>[!note] DM's notes
>The nexus is the center of the Mausoleum and the room holding the gate to the Queen's Prison: the Gate of Suryastra. The passage is a huge carved door with a pedestal set in front of it. The pedestal has five notches that can fit Key Stones. If five key stones are placed within it, the Passage opens and the Crew can move on.

>[!abstract] Picking Up
>Re-describe the Nexus chamber...
>and, after they discover the Hall of Stories, have them met by the Warden again.
>



>[!success] Loot and xp
>Next to the hall of stories is a small vault room, now decayed and split open.
>
>various gems worth 700 gp and the sickle depicted in the warrior's relief (Moon sickle **attune**: Moon Sickle +1 (from TCE, rarity varies)
> This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your druid and ranger spells. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.
> 
> When you use a spell slot to restore hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle)

*Opposite the Great Door of Suryastra is a long hall with one wall of stone and the opposite of pure hewn cinnabar crystals. Magma flows behind the cinnabar casting a beautiful and eerie vermilion light throughout the chamber. The cinnabar wall is intricately carved with the chiseled lines inset with jade. The fillings cause the magma behind the wall to cast shadows on the opposite stone mirroring the carvings. It seems to be a story:*

*Panel 1. Suryastra is shown as a small, thin figure in a seemingly diminished state, surrounded by burning buildings. She is prostrated before a towering figure, a goddess in flowing robes. The goddess is brandishing a huge sword above her head, seemingly swathed in light or shadow.*
*Panel 2. Suryastra, now wielding the sword herself, is shown in intricately carved armor slaying what looks to be a giant rival warrior who towers over her.*
*Panel 3. Suyastra, now shown with the same towering stature of the warrior, confronts and slays a humanoid, demonic tiger creature. The monster is surrounded by small carvings of warlocks casting spells, all reflecting off the beast's hide.
*Panel 4. Suryastra is now shown slaying an angelic figure, the angel's spells reflecting off her. A host of Suryastra's slaves are shown prostrated around the angel, crying, unwilling.*
*Panel 5. Now depicted with angelic wings, Suryastra hovers over a prostrated crowd of small figures. Behind her is a large ziggurat temple. It seems that many of the small figures are engaging in violent, deadly sacrifice.*
*Panel 6. The angelic suryastra stands above a line of figures: her Champions. From right to left: an armored warrior with armor akin to the body you dug out outside, a Priest with a ring of keys and a bloody knife at his belt, a robed Warlock, a Forgemaster with the crystal in one hand and a hammer in the other, an anvil and fire next to him, and finally a Slavemaster surrounded by numerous small, poor figures. Suryastra has numerous other advisors and guards around her as well.*

The next panels seem to be added later, in a new, rushed hand.

*Panel 8.* *Suryastra is carved in a maddened state, kneeling with the bodies of her advisors and other family around her. She brandishes the Black Blade, carved in a way that seems like she is worshiping the sword. The towering goddess figure is shown distantly, and Suryastra is turned away from her.*
*Panel 9. Suryastra, confronted by the five champions: the guardian, the warden, the warlock, the forgemaster, and the slavemaster. The warlock is binding her with powerful magic, seemingly draining the life force of several clerics to imprison her.*
*Panel 6. Suryastra, chained to several carved clerics, is carved above above her Champions in a line, each holding a carved gemstone aloft.*
*Panel 7. The Key Stones being placed in the Nexus pedestal and opening Suryastra's prison-tomb.*
*Panel 10. A carved warning in Cryptic Tanorian, "THE BLASPHEMER QUEEN IS IMPRISONED HERE, SUCH THAT THE WORLD MAY BE FREE OF HER WRATH. **WE SEEK BUT ONE THING: THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BLASPHEMER.***

There are 5 Key Stones.
1 uncovered in the dig (originally from a gate guard) (Mott gives to Saamy)
1 in the Sacrifice Chamber (Archlich Warden's Test of Devotion)
1 in the Embalming Chamber (stealth or combat, Trial of Sacrifice)
1 in the Forge, protected by Uzaxuk (Uzaxuk's Test of Temptation / Strength)
1 in Harmanand's Chamber, (Test of Temptation)

## Scene F - Chamber of Bloodletting

>[!note] Region notes
>The region around the Sacrifice Chamber is a humid prison.

*The crumbling room is large and circular, a large well set in its center. A high stone plinth juts out above the well, steep stairs climbing up to it. The ceiling is vaulting, and your footsteps echo. The well does not seem to be made of brick, but instead of mortared skulls of long-passed sacrifices. Around the well are various depressions--once they might have been baths, now they are sit dry, filling with dust and bones. The back wall of the chamber is obsidian carved with religious iconography. Quietly seated at the back of the plinth is a regal undead, dressed in the same finery displayed in the carving in the Hall of Stories. He has a knife and key ring on his belt. The side walls of the chamber are lined with iron prison cells. Several tunnels snake away from the chamber.*

If the Crew does not start here...

*The room is filled with the bodies. Villagers from the excavation lay half eaten. Closer inspection reveals that many of them are ex-sanguinated. As you step over the bodies, you notice that you recognize some of them from the Tower--the other mercenaries. Zoran Silvergleam, too. One still draws breathe....*

>[!notes] DM's notes
>If the Crew entered here after failing to stop the ritual: they are unconscious, awake to find themselves surrounded by starvelings. The Chosen is gone along with some of his cultists. Mott and the others venture in from a side route, Two Hands betrays them and takes the Key Stone, running away.
>
>If the Crew entered through a side route or they were not able to stop the ritual and Mott and his Crew were teleported: Mott and the others appear here after they are caught in the ritual. The scene is grizzly in this case--half-eaten cultists, Saida the Bloody is dead, but Wael is on his last breathes. Mory Stok has Mott's Key Stone.
>
>If the Crew stopped the ritual and nobody was teleported: Mott and the other Crew are cut off by the earthquake, they meet up later. This room is mostly empty, though a few decaying bodies are left from sacrifices some weeks ago.>
>
>**Foes**:  starved vampires looking for food
>
>**Puzzle:** A Key Stone is locked away behind a magically impervious cinnabar crystal set into the Black Stone Wall at the back of the chamber. **Blood Wall**, covered in carved religious iconography. When the wall is approached, the Warden awakens. He will talk to the Crew, briefly, and indicate that if they want to recover the Key Stone they must "Prove their Devotion" : _"The Key to the Stone is found within you head, use the key to turn black red, be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned."_ The party must use blood and smear it on the wall(where they get it from is up to them), and a duplicate of what the blood came from emerges out of the wall. The party must fight and defeat the duplicate to unlock the **Key Stone**.
>
>If they do, there is also a small chest of 500+5d20 Tanorian gp.

>[!quote] Wael Honorweaver
>*"...the villagers...they were fucking cultists, just like you said at Stardale...carried out some damned ritual. Got Silvergleam through with a knife, and then we teleported down here right into a mob of the bloodthirsty bastards. Some of the cultists ran off with Two Hands. He turned on us when we were trying to stop the ritual--radical Sashas bastard. A young kid--new student, Mory Stok, I think his name is...he got pulled down too. I think he ran off--that way.* **Mott gave him the Key Stone to keep it from the Cult. ** *Save him, if it's not too late already."* 
>
>He refuses healing, saying, "No! they got me. Don't make this harder on yourselves." he coughs blood and turns into a vampire spawn, as does Mott next to him.

>[!quote] The Warden
>"Who are you" - "What do you seek?" - "Why are you here?"
>"I am Suryastra's warden and magister of her sacrifices. I am here to protect our great Queen.
>The Warden will accept the visitors if they can prove their devotion to Sashas, which he takes as an agreement that they wouldn't dare free the Blasphemer Queen.

## Scene F2 - Catacombs

>[!note] DM's notes
>Beneath the upper Chamber of Bloodletting lies the catacombs--the endless maze of skeletons and discarded bodies from centuries of sacrifices.
>The catacombs are filled with wandering spirts--not all hostile. If the Crew falls down the collapsing floor outside the Embalming Chamber, they are trapped in the deepest parts of the catacombs. If they haven't met Shiraj yet, they meet him here. He will follow them if he learns they could lead him to Suryastra. He clues them in on the vampire's life drain ability.
>
>The catacombs are difficult to escape. It takes a skill challenge to get out, and failure (3) means getting stuck for a few days--each time building the chance of a wandering monster.
>
>The most vile of the catacombs is the Sheut--the House of Salt. This is where rival vampires would be brought and mummified alive in salt. A few mummies have survived--as have the spirits of the damned.
>
>**Foes in Sheut**: 1 Caller in Darkness, 2 salt mummies,   4 vampire spawn starvelings that are hostile to all parties (4,500 / player.)
 wz
*These catacombs seems to stretch forever, an endless labyrinth designed without rhyme or reason. The walls are cramped and dark, the walls entirely made from stacked bones of those sacrificed. How many died here? Tens of thousands? Hundreds? How many more will these catacombs claim?*

There are several ways the Crew can get caught in the catacombs. Once in the catacombs, it is easy to get lost. Whenever the Crew takes the **Move** action, they have to also elect someone to make a **Survival (Navigation)** check. On a failed check, the movement is nullified. They have advantage on this check if they are moving carefully. Catacomb exits can only be revealed through successful **Investigation** actions. Each area in the catacombs has a 25% chance of having an exit and a 25% chance of being Sheut. While Sheut is bad, it gives them an abundant source of salt.

There is no treasure in the catacombs. Instead, you get a violent encounter.

## Scene G - Embalming Chamber and Region

>[!note] Region notes
>The Embalming Chamber region is filled with rotroot roots and gravesnags, its dominated by fiendish fauna.

>[!note] DM's notes
>Entrance from outside: Roots of the Ashen Tree (hides lava tubes, they collapse with natural disaster)
>**Description** This room is where the mortal servants of the vampiric rulers would be embalmed and raised as undead in order to serve eternally. There are a mix of cultists here: one high priest (cult devoted), a few mummified acolytes (fanatics), and a host of mummified cult servants (cultists). The mummies generally regard the Crew as being servants coming for embalming. As soon as the Crew enters, the room with leap to life: the underlings will rummage and gather embalming supplies, they'll light their incense and sharpen scalpels, and some will begin to read scripture rites from scrolls. The Devoted will speak to the Crew in Tanorian, beckoning them to lay on the embalming tables.
>
>The Cleric is addled from decay, and won't accept that there are no bodies to be embalmed.
>
>**Hazards:** Collapsing floor at the entrance leading to the back of the **Catacombs**.

*A dark room, expansive enough that torches don't illuminate the corners, that smells of dust, incense, and long-dried blood. Numerous stone stools line the walls, many with mummified bodies wraped with simple embroidered linens sitting in them. Between the mummified bodies are narrow halls that plunge into the dark. Ancient stone tables sit in the depressed center theater. At the back, just barely illuminated, is a central stool seating a large mummy dressed in finery far too large for her desiccated form--perhaps she was once much larger a woman than she is now, the same as depicted in the Hall of Stories. When you enter, the mummies in the chamber spring to life. The Devoted approaches you as the other mummies begin to busy themselves with supplies, incense, torches, etc.*

*The Devoted speaks in Cryptic Tanorian; she has lost her mind over the last five millennia, essentially believing the time to be just after Suryastra's imprisonment during the preparations for the Challengers:*

>[!quote] The Slavemaster:
>
*"You are here to help prepare for the coming of the Challengers, yes? They will be arriving any day now! Finally, perhaps, a hero sent by Sashas to defeat her Blasphemer may come to us. **What is your name?**"*
>
>**DC 13 Deception** can fake a Cryptic Tanorian name -> *"Hmm..I don't recall your arrival. Are you one of the slaves?"*
>on failure: -> *"Unusual name. Foreign...you must be one of the slaves! Ah perfect that you came to me. Come, we'll prepare you."*
>
>If the Crew can keep deceiving her, they can buy time while they search the chamber (skill challenge! 3 failures either represent repeated damage to a character currently being embalmed OR things that make the Slavemaster believe they are slaves that need to be punished / embalmed)
>If they fail, she will really try her best to embalm them. If they start to lightly resist, she'll push forward. If they heavily resist or fight back, she'll turn quite stern and go into full slave-master mode.

...telling you it is time for your embalming, and beckoning towards the tables in the theater. If someone goes willingly, they can be used to distract the clerics as the others search the room. **The Devoted's Key Stone is hidden on her person--she reveals it as she begins an embalming, believing it is to take the place of the embalmed's heart**. This can be a skill challenge--giving yourself up to embalming is an auto success and lowers the DC of everything else, but this can also be done normally. If the Crew patently denies any embalming and also behaves suspiciously (not responding well to the cleric, 3 failures in the skill challenge), then combat could initiate. For every roll in the skill challenge if someone is being embalmed, they take 15 damage.*

>[!success] Loot and XP
>The Embalming Chamber houses one of the head priests of the Mausoleum, who carries with him a **Key Stone**.
>
>Foes: 5x Cultists of the Grand Indulger (M10), 3x Mummy Guardian + Cult Fanatic of the Grand Indulger (CR 5), 1x Devoted of the GI (CR 8): 2,400 / player.
>
>**Loot:** 5x Elixirs of Vital Blood (1 lost hit die), scroll of conjure lesser demons, scroll of vampiric touch, Scroll of Sunbeam, 700 Tanorian gp.

## Scene I - The Forge

*The Forge is a low-ceilinged chamber with multiple levels shaped like half-rings encircling a central crucible. The whole room is webbed with chains, levers, and pulleys, completely silent but ready to clatter like wind chimes. The room is criss-crossed with stone aqueducts feeding lava to the crucible and is suffused with dense steam, lightly obscuring vision. Several halls and stairs twist around the sides of the chamber, all filled with chains. *
**DC 15 arcana** - The forge's fires seem to be fed by some sort of arcane or unnatural source--they burn a sickening green.
**DC 20 arcana** - Fire like this--the sulfuric smell in the air--it all points to the presence of a demon.
*The lowest ring, some 60 feet below, is set with a great mechanical hammer and anvil. The ground around the anvil is littered with weapons, half-finished or broken. A noble-looking statue bears a Key Stone aloft over its head. As you scan the chamber, a huge beast steps into view on the second ring down--a monster, perhaps 16 ft/ 5 m tall covered in thick fleshy chitin. Its head is dog-like, but just human enough to send chills down your spine. It has four arms, two ending in huge hulking claws and two small, almost vestigial limbs protruding from its gut. Its four arms and its neck are bound by ethereal chains that can only be unlocked by a special key (held by the Apprentice or in Harmanand's chamber). While the Shackles are on, Uzaxuk cannot leave the forge or attack or be attacked, but he can grab the Key Stone and protect it if he detects the Crew trying to steal it.*

>[!note] DM's notes
>Entrance from outside: Roots of the Ashen Tree (hides lava tubes, they collapse with natural disaster)
>
>**Description** The Red Warlock Harmanand summoned the glabrezu Uzaxuk and bound him using enchanted chains to the demon's wrists and neck. Uzaxuk brought with him the fiery heat of the Abyss which feeds the forge fires and allows it to create Acheron weapons, which were part of the original test for Challengers: forge a powerful weapon of their own, both to help defeat Suryastra and to help resist the temptation of the Blade.
>The forgemaster has long been sealed away, but Uzaxuk still stalks the fires, waiting to be freed. He's been imprisoned for over five thousand years. He's desperate for interaction--and violence. He'll offer knowledge, wealth, and power to be freed--but his freedom also involves the slaughter of those that free him!
>
>**Uzaxuk's behavior**  If he discovers the Crew snooping around, he jealously protects the Key Stone and the armor and weapons at the crucible until the Crew can free him. They can try to distract him and steal the items.

>[!quote] Uzaxuk
>*"A living soul enters my forge! I have not set eyes upon an outsider for almost a millennia. Come, closer, so I might speak to you."*
>
>*"Ahh....now, why are you here? No--wait, the phrase, What do you Seek?*
>Uzaxuk, who was summoned by Harmanand after Suryastra's imprisonment, 
>*"Perhaps we can be of help to each other. I have a Key Stone that you need to enter Suryastra's Hall. I will give it to you, and more, if you can help free me from this place. For five millennia I have been imprisoned--what I wish most of all is to see my home once again. For this gift, I will give you knowledge, and strength beyond your imagining! Weapons, too, I can offer you from my forge."*
>
>**If his shackles are unlocked**
>*"Yes! My body has finally been unshackled! Now, I will UNSHACKLE MY SOUL!"*

## Chamber of Harmanand

>[!note] Region notes
>The Region around the Chamber of Harmanand is nearer to the surface, and crevices pour ash and dust throughout the halls. It is akin to an Egyptian tomb. Its filled with bugs too!

>[!note] DM's note
>
>Harmanand, an early planar wizard, has long been corrupted by the extraplanar energy suffusing his lair. He and his apprentices have been transformed into Nothics, obsessed with all things arcane.
>Harmanand was the one that devised Suryastra's imprisonment. He is a master of magics that devour the souls of the living as their fuel, and with this power he created Suryastra's prison and together he and the Champions created the Trials. However, no Challenger was able to pass the Trials over the course of 5,000 years. Harmanand grew corrupted, turned into a monster, and his warlock's chamber was torn apart by Astral magic.
>
>Now, corrupted, he and his nothics watch over the ruins, waiting for Challengers that they know will fail. He lost all hope in defeating Suryastra, but he has gained a sick enjoyment in corrupting and killing those who enter his once-righteous prison.

>[!note] Harmanand's behavior
>Harmanand believes himself to generally be the arbiter of the Temptation Test. Either the Crew approaches him seeking Uzaxuk's key, or he tempts them with arcane knowledge. Either case, he welcomes them from the shadows without directly revealing himself. He begins quite friendly, but his speech reveals a darger tinge to his mind--a murderous tone wrought from 5000 years of despair.
>
>In the former: he immediately goes on a rant about the failures of 5000 years of Challengers, shrieks to initiate an Infestation, and attacks. He tries to delay them--after 8 rounds of combat, Vampire Spawn Starvelings will begin to flood the chamber.
>
>In the latter: he welcomes them, slowly getting closer and talking to them as he sets up his Trial. He describes his Grand Design, the Trials, the righteousness of it all, and the goal of destroying Suryastra.

>[!warning] Harmanand's Trial
>
>**Base: Mouth of Sauron**
>*"Before you go on your way--I would bestow upon you boons to help you defeat the Blasphemer. Here, taste the boons I can share with you:"* Harmanand grants a temporarily free Haste spell
>*"This, too, I will share:"* He holds up a **Key Stone**.
>
>He draws one of his nothics over, and uses its eye as a crystal ball. He shows the Crew visions of their allies, trapped in the catacombs: Saamy and Volania, Mott and the others--they are injured, the monk is not there.
>
>*"These boons draw their power from a living soul--luckily, there are others that followed you into this Mausoleum. My apprentices have their eyes throughout these tunnels. They found these people, who arrived shortly after you...Do you know them? Their deaths will be perfect to fuel these powers I offer.*
>
>If the Crew takes the bait:
>*"Wrong. You are weak! Surely you are here, drawn and tempted by the power of the Black Blade! If I allow you to leave and take it for yourself, you will surely use it for yourself and fall under its spell--I cannot let you live!"*
>
>Harmanand screeches and begins combat.

>[!success] Loot
>Libram of Souls and Flesh +1 **atune** (+1 Grimoire! **attune**) , 750 Tanorian gold, +1 Shield
>
>- **The Eye of Harmanand (attune)**: when Harmanand lies dead, his great wet glassy eye twists and pulls itself from his head. It hovers in the air above his corpse.
>  -If touched, you get a sense of powerful magic--though it can only be activated if placed in its proper place!
>  -Upon death, the Eye latches onto your soul--preventing it from going elsewhere.
>  -You can remove the Eye from your head, it enlarges, and you can use it as a sort of **Crystal Ball**, though any noises are garbled as if you are listening from below water. You can use this ability as many times per day as you like, though if the scry fails the psychic backlash is so disconcerning that you cannot do this again until the next long rest.



Wizard: Boon of the Conduit:
![[Pasted image 20240228145216.png]]

Druid: Boon of the Wild-one: Your physical body begins to mutate, permanently taking on an aspect of the wild: Keen Hearing, Keen Sight, Keen Smell, (all of these give Alert feat as well as normal adv on perception) Keen Taste (detect poison and poisonous creatures within 30 ft)
Cleric: The Fires of Uruvand: - When you roll fire damage for a spell you cast, you can reroll any roll of 1 or 2 on the fire damage dice, but you must use the new roll.
- Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can cause flames to wreathe you until the end of your next turn. The flames don’t harm you or your possessions, and they shed bright light out to 30 feet and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the flames are present, any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee attack takes 1d4 fire damage.
Fighter: Boon of the Inevitable: Attacks that you make as part of an action surge gain advantage. Before you make any of these attacks, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to your attack roll to gain a +10 bonus to damage.
Ranger: Hunter's Focus: If a creature that you've targeted with Hunter's Mark forces you to make a saving throw, add 1d6 to your roll. You can also add this when attempting to escape a grapple.
Paladin: Inspiring Glory: When you use your lay on hands feature to heal someone, you also grant them one inspiration point that expires at the end of the combat.

# M. Chamber of the Queen

As the Crew enters the chamber of the queen, they are visited by Sashas in ethereal form.

>[!quote] Sashas
>*"You are my Chosen. You must destroy the Blasphemer, she who turned from me and was corrupted. Do this, and be rewarded with my Boon."*

Suryastra has been dominated by the Spirit of Bash. This happened as she was being entombed--Bash did not want to be entombed! So how is she bound there? She is protected by a number of cultist thralls (self blinded, but gifted sight by Sashas' eye, thus they cannot be charmed) that have put various bindings on her:

1. Chaining her wings with 4 ethereal chains maintained by the life-force of 4 servants.

Suryastra the Great. She is a Vampire Dreadknight wielding the Thief Blade. She has numerous powers that she's stolen over her life:
Black wings of an angel (50 ft fly speed)
Extra die of weapon damage (brute from gladiator Giant)
**_Limited Magic Immunity._** The Suryastra can't be affected or detected by spells of 1st level or lower unless she wishes to be. She has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.

##### The Thief Blade
The Thief Blade is a magic, sentient greatsword (2d6 damage) created by and imbued with the mind of Bash. It grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. It deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to anyone who can cast arcane spells.
The Thief Blade can steal the powers, secrets, and belief in any being it kills. For example, if the Thief Blade is used to kill a dragon, the wielder can steal the dragon's breath weapon. If it is used to kill an angel, the wielder can steal its wings. If the wielder kills a deity or an Apotheid, they can steal the being's identity and worshipers, thus becoming a deity or Apotheid themselves. These benefits only last while the wielder is attuned to the Thief Blade.
If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 6d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by Bash, as if by the [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.
The Thief Blade has the following random properties:
- 1 minor beneficial property: while attuned to it, you cannot be charmed or frightened by anything except the Thief Blade itself.
- 1 major beneficial property: while attuned to it, the weapon does an extra dice of damage.
- 2 major detrimental properties:
	- When attuned to the Thief Blade, all creatures and plants of challenge rating 0 die instantly when within 10 feet of the blade. This includes almost all small wild animals and most commoners. Creatures killed in this way appear to have been killed by a physical sword attack, even though no attack needs to be made. Plants wither and die, though sometimes the spirit of Bash wants to slice those too, and so leaves falling around the wielder could be shredded in mid-air.
	- While attuned to the Thief Blade, each time you kill a creature with the Blade and absorb some of its power, there is a 50% chance that Bash tries to possess you. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma save, Bash succeeds and Dominates you until he is temporarily banished using magic such as dispel evil and good. Dispel Evil and Good, when used in this way, uses its *dismissal* ability, rather than its *break enchantment* ability, which gives Bash a CHA saving throw (he has +18, so it is very difficult to get rid of him.)

**Spirit of Bash.** While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain effect until the start of your next turn.
**Sentience.** The _Thief Blade_ is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 30 (+10). It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand all languages.
