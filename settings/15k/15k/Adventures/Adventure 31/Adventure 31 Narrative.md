### Safelight Inn

Safelight Inn, a refuge that many travelers find when they are afriad. It's run by a pair of archons, a Hound named Barney and a Lantern Archon named Alfariel. They take in people looking for safety, and generally the inn has several refugees in it. She serves food, though it is only for comfort as food offers no sustenance here.
- The Gith will attack the Inn, drawn by the power of the Crew's magic. The Innkeepers will shepherd refugees into the basement, but will inquire with the Crew what powerful magic they bear that has drawn such Gith pirates. If they find out the Crew is harboring the Wand of Orcus or are demon worshipers, they will grow hostile and try to summon Heavenly Judgement.

### Sphinx

Thunderous roar, and a rapid pace, Always running but yet stuck in place. Endless mouth that can not scream, Laid in bed, but can not dream. - River

I'm the part of a bird that's not in the sky -- I swim through the ocean and yet remain dry. - Shadow

There are four siblings in this world, all born together at the beginning of time. The first runs and never wearies. The second eats and is never full. The third drinks but is always parched. The fourth whistles a song without end. What are they? - Water, Fire, Earth, Air

Death - eats
Pestilence -  drink
War - runs
Famine - 

Runs - Water
Drinks - Earth
Fire - eats
Wind - Whistles


Fail any guess, and I'll take from you 1 year.

### Psychic Wind
1d20 for each day traveling through the Astral - on a 1 or 2, the Wind happens.
A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas,
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this
powerful force.
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes,
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal
in a few rounds.
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers
journeying together suffers the same location effect.
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to
determine the location and mental effects.
