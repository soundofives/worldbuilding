**_Limited Magic Immunity._**Â The Suryastra can't be affected or detected by spells of 1st level or lower unless she wishes to be. She has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.
(~60 - 100 dpt, which is enough to take out about 1 PC / 1-2 rounds if she JUST attacks. Along with her grasping strike and charm, she'll probably avg out to 1 PC / turn. They'll really need to be on their game.)

**Holy Blood**. Upon being dealt slashing or piercing melee damage, AND after feeding, Suryastra's blood sprays out, poisoning the attacker. A **DC 15** CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute (disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks) and can attempt a new save at the end of every round.

**Inspire Fury** . Creatures charmed by Suryastra have resistance to non-magical damage and treat all creatures except her as hostile.
