 The Pilot adventure.
Goals:
- Get introduced to the Tower, some of its mysteries, and some NPCs.
- Investigate the **Blocked Wing** of the Crypt. A trio of students went down there some time ago and never returned. What were they doing? Are they still down there?
	- Three students (Desi, Nedavir, and Rashil) attempted to become liches. Their rituals went awry, and combined them all into a mutant Flesh Golem called "Ned", as it seems Nedavir's mind is more forward. The Flesh Golem only speaks as a collective, "we". Ned has been surviving on rats and other small creatures, is heavily influenced by "The Voice in the Walls" (Fraz) that tells him to do horrible things. Ned blocked themselves into the Blocked Wing to prevent further damage and to try to continue their studies, though they can't cast spells anymore. Ned is frightened of outsiders discovering their mistake, and so they send their undead minions to deal with the Crew, but will try to talk to them if they make it to his chamber.

### Scene 1, the Tour


>*You've just been transferred from your previous posts to your new contract on the **[[The Wandering Tower of the Mad Mage]]**. Right now, the Tower sits atop a forested hill outside the walls of **[[Sinisa]]**. You were each brought from the city by an enchanted carriage seemingly without a driver.
>Each of you have been assigned to a loose Sergeantry under the swordsman Maximo, who has been in the mercenary Company for a while. The sight that greets you after stepping out of the carriage is an imposing one:
>The Tower is huge, made of countless towers and chambers that jut outwards, stacked in a way that seems entirely unsturdy. The Tower itself is sitting on a large hunk of rock, an island supported by several huge wooden legs. Several buildings sit around the base of the Tower, along with an extensive **[[Garden]]** and grove. The Tower rises for several tens of stories with numerous balconies overlooking the wide country below them. Windows glow with candlelight and shifting magical glows. A large ball of surging purple magic hovers above a rotund addition near the top of the Tower, swirling and highlighting the stars above it.
>A ghost floats through the two huge wooden doors at the front of the Tower just before they are swept open by an [[Gizigrut | ogre-ish doorman]].*

>[!quote] [[Taforayesh]]
>*The ghost floats towards you. He's dressed in ornate ethereal robes and his ghostly hair is unkempt. He was an elf in life, tall and thin. He carries a long unrolled scroll infront of him.*
>
>**"You must be the new Crewmembers. A little later than expected, but no matter. I am Taforayesh, advisor to the High Wizardead. Now, please, follow me. I'll show you around the Tower and show you to your quarters."
>
>"The Tower serves to house you and the other members of the Crew alongside the apprentices, staff, Wizardeads, and Witcheads. This is the Atrium."**
>
>*Taforayesh leads you into the entry hall, a vaulting chamber lit a miniature sun. The ceiling mimics a blue sky, complete with swirling clouds. The walls are adorned with ancient tapestries and stained-glass windows. Several doors and archways lead off from the room.*
>
>**"From here you can reach the mess hall, where meals are served at dawn, mid-day, and dusk. Your meals here are provided, so long as you continue your contracts. You can also reach the Tower crypts from a side stairwell. Ahead of us you can find a [[Chapel to the Myriad]]--there you can also find our [[Hospital Ward]], should you be injured or get in the ill-graces of our doorman, Gizigrut."**
>
>*At the back end of the Atrium is a wide spiral staircase. Taforayesh floats up. As you walk up, the vaulted ceiling turns to a brief interlude of candle-lit stone before opening to the next floor, a huge multi-story library*
>
>**"[[The Library]]. Should you need to access any of the countless tomes or scrolls collected by the Tower over the centuries, all you need is to ask our Archivist, [[Sora]]."**
>
>*The library's floor is a labyrinth of tall bookcases, but the library itself extends several stories up, with bridges, catwalks, and platforms criss-crossing from one side to the next. Ladders, stairs, and even trees climb the walls and shelves of the library. An old woman stands at the base of one of these ladders, shifting to a new position. She turns to you. Her face is jovial, but lined by a life of stress.*

>[!quote] Sora
>**"New Crew! Wonderful! Feel free to use the library however you like, but if a section of the library seems off-limits, then it is. Don't try to force open any enchanted doors--you may turn into a fish."**
>

>[!quote] Taforayesh
> *Taforayesh continues up a central staircase that passes through the whole height of the library.*
> 
> **These next few floors are quartering for our staff. Show them any disrespect and the High Wizardead has decreed that your ears shall be removed.**
> 
> 

>[!warning] Perception, DC 10
>It's here that you notice something odd. In the corner of the platform here, and along the candle-lit hallway, there seem to be shadows moving along, but no one is casting them. Not only that, but one moves towards you and seems to go up the stairs. As it passes by, you think you hear hushed, cryptic whispers. Now that you've seen them here, you think you noticed them throughout the floors below you as well.
>
>If asked, Taforayesh says:
>
>**"Ah. Yes. Don't worry about the Shades, they're harmless."**
>
>>[!warning] Arcana, DC 10
>>Shades like these are technically a form of undead creature, created by a violent death at the hands of powerful shadow magic. Shades kill by draining the very lifeforce of their victims.
>>>[!warning] Arcana, DC 15
>>>Normally, you know, Shades have an insatiable desire to consume the strength of the living, though these ones seem docile.


>[!quote] Taforayesh
>
>*You continue upwards for several floors, each dedicated to staff chambers. Finally, the stairwell opens into a lively open rotunda. Boisterous voices come from beyond a stone archway to your left, and a sign hanging above the archway reads, "WIZARD'S KNOBBLY KNOB". The rotunda opens to a wide balcony in front of you, set with training dummies and target boards. A hallway to your right is lined with several doors.*
>
>**"I feel it below the scholarly mentality of the Tower, but the High Wizardead chooses to keep this establishment open, much to my chagrin. You are welcome to the tavern, though you must pay for your own drinks here. And try not to drunkenly kill anyone like one of the last Crewmembers. The balcony is part of our training area, used by both Crewmembers and apprentices alike. Down this hall are your rooms. Please, follow me.**
>
>*Several of the doors open to small, multi-level spires that each serve as living quarters. The rooms are mostly bare, but comfortable. They are furnished simply with a bed on the upper balcony of the spires and a small seating area in the antechamber below. There are racks for weapons and armor, and plenty of room for storage and personalization. Each member has their own private room. At the end of the hall that the spires connect to is a communal area equipped with a hearth for socializing. A final door leads to a private balcony training ground for combat practice.*
>
>**"The rest of the tour can be done on your own time. As it is getting late, I'll leave you to your rooms. Your first assignment will start in the morning."**

>[!check] XP
>You've finished the first tour! 60 XP to all.

The players can do whatever they want right now. Most of the Tower is open to them, they can explore or go to the Wizard's Knobbly Knob, where a few apprentices are hanging out.

#### The Knobbly Knob

>[!tip] ---
>Laughing voices carry out of the Knobbly Knob. When you enter, the wooden crow Fuckwit insults you. You see the apprentices, Zoran, Klia, Milo, Drakewolf, and Lei are all sitting around two tables pushed together sharing drinks. Gadovan is sitting behind them, trying to engage with the close friends.
>
>Whiff and Breeze are working the bar, preparing another round of drinks.
>
>Hasur is sitting in a dark corner, reading a legal tome by candlelight and sipping a strong drink. 
>
>Breeze welcomes you in with a gentle smile and glow, and Whiff ushers you to the bar. After a brief time at the bar, Drakewolf calls you over to join them at the tables. They re-arrange and pull up a third table into the group.

New scholars [[Zoran Silvergleam]], [[Klialtoth Faerkris]], and [[Milo]].
Apprentices [[Zoran Drakewolf]] and [[Lei of the Flaming Realms]].
Staff: [[Gadovan Moonglade]], [[Breeze]] + [[Whiff]], [[Hasur Highfallow]].

>[!check] XP
>60 XP for socializing or exploring

#### Exploring the Tower
If the PCs choose to explore the Tower, they can. Generally, at this time of night, the Tower is quiet. Some students are in the library or the [[Enchantment Chamber]]. Here's some funky things they might notice or people they might run into.

1. Samira, chaplain of the Myriad, is heading back to her room. She introduces herself to the new Crewmembers and hands them healing tinctures blessed by

### Scene 2, the Crypts

>[!quote] Taforayesh
>*You are awoken early in the morning by Taforayesh, again carrying his long scroll in front of him. You see now it's an extremely long checklist. He gathers each of you in the small common area outside your chambers.*
>
>**"Alright. Now that I've gathered you all, it's time for your first job. Let's see...ah. Yes. Well, I need you to go check up on three apprentices who ventured into the [[Crypts]] and haven't come out. Go and find them if you can."**
>
>*If asked when the apprentices were lost, Taforayesh checks his list and notices that this item was added over a year ago.*

Circumstance:
>Three students (Desi, Nedavir, and Rashil) attempted to become liches. Their rituals went awry, and combined them all into a mutant Flesh Golem called "Ned", as it seems Nedavir's mind is more forward. The Flesh Golem only speaks as a collective, "we". Ned has been surviving on rats and other small creatures, is heavily influenced by "The Voice in the Walls" (Fraz) that tells him to do horrible things. Ned blocked themselves into the Blocked Wing to prevent further damage and to try to continue their studies, though they can't cast spells anymore. Ned is frightened of outsiders discovering their mistake, and so they send their undead minions to deal with the Crew, but will try to talk to them if they make it to his chamber.

If the PCs ask around before going into the Crypts, they'll find most people in the [[Library]], the [[Mess]], or the [[Enchantment Chamber]]. 

1. Drakewolf is one of the only students that knows much about the Crypts, having lightly explored them before. Other students will point towards him for advise if asked. Drakewolf will offer to guide the PCs into the Blocked Wing, but they'll owe him a no-questions asked favor.

The other Crewmembers are away on holiday in Sinisa, as are some of the older students. [[Lirael Stormcaller]] is heading to the Mess when the PCs leave their rooms, and she introduces herself to them.

>[!quote] Lirael Stormcaller
>*Professor Lirael Stormcaller is a tall and elegant human woman with a commanding presence. She has striking silver hair that cascades down to her waist, contrasting with her deep emerald eyes. Her robes, adorned with intricate mystic patterns, reflect her mastery of the forces of nature.*
>
>**"Ah, you must be the new Crewmembers. I am Lirael Stormcaller, one of the professors here. We were sorely in need of new Crew--I'm glad you're here."**
