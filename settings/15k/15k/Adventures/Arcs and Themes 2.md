## The Great Arc

Two hundred years ago, **Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath**, made a grand play to become ruler of the Abyss by staging a coup against **the Demon King Fraz Urb'luu**. To challenge the King, Orcus absorbed the power of the Last Word, an unimaginably dangerous magic that gives him the power to kill with a single utterance. Orcus moved on Fraz, allying with other Demon Lords and **the mortal wizard Lyzandred and his apprentice Zagyg** to imprison the Demon King in **the Last and First City**, realm of the rising **god-necromancer, Vecna**. Although Fraz was ousted, the other Demon Lords spurned Orcus's rule. How could he be Demon King when upstart Vecna claimed to rival his power over undeath? Orcus grew a vampiric cult within the upper-echelons of the Last and First City and began seeking **the Thief Blade**, an artifact capable of stealing Vecna's necromantic power and placing it in the hands of one of Orcus's vampire servants.
>[!note] The Rivals
>**Orcus** desires sovereignty over the living and the dead alike. The one thing the Prince of Undeath despises most is contention over his authority -- either from Gods claiming their flock or rival necromancers arrogating the souls of the dead for themselves. Orcus wishes to turn all Life to worship all Dead to his pawns.
>**Vecna** built the Eternal Empire from the ground up, rising as god-necromancer of the Last and First City. As the Candle King grows more powerful, arrogant, and proud, his paranoia deepens. Vecna will do whatever it takes to keep his Empire, grow his power, and eliminate claimants to his throne.
>**Fraz** waits in his magical prison, orchestrating his revenge:    Orcus's spectacular failure when Fraz reclaims his Dominion and the catastrophic downfall of the Eternal Empire that dared imprison Fraz Urb'luu. The Lord of Deceit lives for the moment when all of his schemes, tricks, illusions, and manipulations culminate in the hope in his victim's eyes turning to despair when they realize they never could defeat him.

In the midst of Orcus's plot, the ousted Demon King Fraz was not idle. The Lord of Illusions took advantage of Zagyg's sinister apprentice, **Tasha**, to hold Zagyg's son, Yrah, hostage and manipulate the wizard.
>[!note] The Wizards
>**Zagyg** is one of the most powerful spellcasters the world had ever seen, though it was Zagyg's hubris that brought him into a deal with Orcus to imprison the Demon King Fraz. While Zagyg's power grew, Fraz took hold of the wizard's beloved son Yrah, and manipulated Zagyg to be a double-agent between the two Demon Lords in exchange for Yrah's freedom.
>**Tasha** showed that even the Demon King was not immune to her deviousness. Tasha fled Zagyg's Tower with Fraz's powerful Staff and many of Zagyg's magical tomes. She began cavorting with demons, rising to become the world's foremost demonologists and writing her magnum opus: the Demonomicon, which all demonkind feared. With it, she began imprisoning and manipulating Demon Lords for her own chaotic goals.

Fraz's scheming extended far: he used his web of servants to gather **a group of adventurers**: a Crew that Fraz would use as a weapon of revenge against Orcus, Zagyg, and Tasha, and a discordant tool against Vecna's Empire to push it ever closer to collapse...

## Further examination

#### ORCUS'S PLAN:
**Destroy the upstart Vecna, who claims Orcus's domain for himself, and become Demon King.**
#### FRAZ'S PLAN:
**Escape the Godtrap and get revenge on Orcus, Zagyg, Tasha, and the Eternal Empire.**

### The downfall of Fraz Urb'luu
Hundreds of years ago, Orcus began his play for the Abyssal Throne by ousting the Demon King Fraz Urb'luu. Orcus enlisted the aid of Lyzandred and his apprentice Zagyg to summon Fraz and imprison him. Orcus granted these wizards each a single request:
- Lyzandred: "In all my studies on the magic of time, I am yet mortal. I wish to escape death." Orcus gave Lyzandred the secret to Lichdom. The mage took this power, but it would eventually drive him mad. He later fled to an isolated realm in the outskirts of the Planescape.
- Zagyg: "I wish for a way to learn all the secrets of this world, even from those who have died long ago." Orcus taught Zagyg to summon forth the spirits of those long dead, giving him the basis for his magical school. The Prince of Undeath, however, will never truly relinquish control of the spirits that Zagyg raises.
Lyzandred and Fraz sought to summon Fraz. In order for the summoning to work, Fraz needs to leave willingly. Orcus harnessed the threat of the Last Word to form a demonic alliance and move on Fraz's realm of Hollow's Heart. The pressure forced Fraz to accept the mortal wizards' summons into the Godtrap -- the magical construction of Lyzandred and Zagyg to imprison the Demon King and siphon his magic away for centuries.

After Fraz's imprisonment, Orcus's allies refused to accept his rule because of the rise of Vecna, whose power threatened to cast Orcus as inferior. Orcus began searching for the Thief Blade to destroy Vecna and steal his power.

### Fraz's schemes for freedom
After Lyzandred fled in madness, Zagyg took on an apprentice, Tasha, whom he scandalously married. Tasha held little love for Zagyg, as her ambitions lay in becoming the most potent demonologist ever seen. She did, however, bear Zagyg a child who was beloved by Zagyg: Yrah. Tasha began secretly meeting with the imprisoned demon lord, learning his secrets over years in exchange for her help in luring the young Yrah into the Godtrap. Fraz ripped out Yrah's heart, dominating him and holding him hostage. Fraz forced Zagyg to act as a double-agent against Orcus. The Prince of Undeath was using Zagyg to seek out of the Thief Blade -- in secret, Zagyg would deliver the Blade to Fraz in exchange for his son's freedom. With the Thief Blade in hand, Fraz would lovingly use it to strike down Orcus and sew chaos to tear the Empire apart.

After Yrah's domination, Tasha absconded with Fraz's powerful Staff and Zagyg's most precious tomes, including the grimoire of his compiled accomplishments: the Tome of Zyx.

### The Demonomicon
Tasha used her power to terrorize countrysides, found nations, and perfect her ability to control demons as the Witch Queen of Perrenland, Natasha the Dark, Iggwilv, Hura of Ket, and other names. She built upon Zagyg's Tome of Zyx, turning the magical treatise in the foundation of her magnum opus: the Demonomicon. She summoned and trapped the demon lord Grazzt, but she ended up falling in love with her prisoner--and he with his captor. Tasha and Grazzt's relationship was twisted in every way. In fits of rage each would betray the other: at one time, Tasha ended up a prisoner herself in Grazzt's realm of Azzagrat. Tasha worked with other Demon Lords as well, and even for Vecna, entering a pact with him to imprison Orcus's allies. Demogorgon and several other demon lords fell to her, finding themselves trapped within the pages of the Demonomicon. To keep these Abyssal lords imprisoned, she creates the hidden realm of Prismeer. Here she took on a new role as an archmage and instructor, teaching students the ways of conjuration.

Tasha has few friends in this story. Orcus, though he has worked with her in the past, reviles the Demonomicon for the control it grants over demons. Fraz despises her for her theft of his Staff. Vecna yearns for her power and the demonic secrets she refuses to share -- though he did entreat her and forge a fey pact. Zagyg, while she hurt him with her betrayal, still holds some love for her -- however undeserving she is.


Other figure to introduce to Tasha's realm: the bound Tsojcanth

#### VECNA'S PARANOIA:
**Ensure the ascendancy of the Empire and become the undisputed Master of Undeath.**

Vecna is an Apotheid: a mortal-turned god by the power given to him by his people. Before this episode, he was a powerful necromancer and god -- he was a ruthless conqueror, but he wasn't entirely evil or malevolent. He was graceful, and truly wished to maintain the Eternal Empire as a haven for all peoples. Yet, over the millennia, he had grown fearful of his Empire crumbling and his powers being lost. When Fraz Urb'luu was ousted and Orcus set his sights on eliminating Vecna, the Emperor's fears were realized. Over the last two hundred years, since he learned of Orcus's ire, Vecna constructed together layer after layer of protections out of a raving paranoia for his life and power. He delved further into vile magics as a means to defeat the looming demon lord, egged on by the imprisoned Fraz Urb'luu. Vecna saw the imprisoned demon as a potential ally against Orcus, learning from him but unknowingly becoming twisted by the whispers of the Prince of Lies. He even went to implore Tasha for aid after she returned from Azzagrat. She, the foremost mind on the Abyssal, would surely know a way to defeat Orcus. Vecna made a deal with her, and she began working to imprison Orcus's allies within the Demonomicon -- all it cost Vecna was "whatever he loses..." Vecna compiled his writings into the Book of Vile Darkness, which he continues to pen. Recently, Vecna acquired an artifact once used against Tasha's summoned demon armies: the Crook of Rao -- though he is loathe to call upon the Crook's powers lest it doom the entire plane.

#### Other players:
**Levistus**, Lord of the Fifth circle of Hell, has been bound to a glacial prison by Asmodeus and desires only to be free and get revenge on Asmodeus. Levistus has been discretely helping Orcus achieve his goals of gaining greater power, trading the secret of attaining the Last Word from the Pale Night in exchange for Orcus's promise to help free Levistus (in winning the Blood War and sacking the Nine Hells). The Last Word is one of the few magics capable of threatening Asmodeus -- as such, Levistus believes it will be enough to coerce the Archdevil into freeing Levistus. When the Demon Lords started vanishing over the last 200 years, the demonic efforts in escaping the Abyss in the Blood War were hamstrung and Levistus's plans for the downfall of Hell were thrown out of balance. Levistus cultivated a new servant: a paladin-turned-warlock Maximo, who Levistus would direct to discover what happened to the Demon Lords (and save them) or aid Orcus in killing the Emperor (making Orcus the undisputed God of Undeath, capable of pushing into Hell.)

Another vein, which makes it so **Levistus** is against both Orcus AND Uzaxuk: Asmodeus sees this opportunity to clinch an end to the Blood War through diplomacy. Orcus is the last remaining Demon Lord. He cannot hope to continue the war alone. Asmodeus offers Orcus a place in the Hells, enraging the pride of Levistus, who would never see himself become the equal to an ex-Demon Lord. Levistus convinces Orcus to pursue Vecna's power and become a true God of Undeath. If Orcus succeeds, he could refuse Asmodeus's offer. If he fails, he will be removed from the playing field all together.

### The Context
The Last and First City, heart of the Shadaean Empire, is embroiled in an underground civil war between the Duskivaines and the Ishurs, the two great families that control the Cycladene Church and the Bank of Miros. They are tightly woven into the Bureaucracy, the Criminal Underground, and the war between the Cycladenes and the Myriad. Almost all social tension and threads of control can be traced back to one of these two families interlocked in a centuries-long chess game for power.

The Myriad - Cycladene war is a creation of Fraz Urb'luu, who wanted to sew the seeds of discord that would rip the Last and First City apart. The Myriad, originally a religion from the eastern lands of Oz'Leshah and the New Tanorian Empire, was hijaked by Fraz's manipulations and influence. While many deities of the Myriad are legitimate, some falsely worship their gods: "Fraz-Urb'luu's Cults of Deception pose as worshipers of a divine power, infiltrating or founding congregations and precipitating crises, pushing worshipers to make ever-escalating moral compromises in the supposed pursuit of an ever out-of-reach greater good. Such cults are often led or supported by one of the succubi or rakshasas that form the core of the Great Deceiver's cohort."

The Cycladenes are not much more innocent. They are an old religion, borne from a corruption of the ancient traditions of Krinica / Sinisar Empire. The Cycle of Twins has been infiltrated by Orcus and his vampire cult. The Cycladenes, while not being the most likeable, are the defenders. They are protesting a hostile takeover by the Myriad, and would love to see the war end -- with their church still intact. Orcus, too, would like this: the longer he can keep his cult secret the better. Also, while the Cycladenes do use the Brother's Company mercenaries, their deal with Adnan is likely off due to his assassination.

##### The Prophecy:
- The Prophecy speaks of a danger to the Emperor by someone influenced by the Abyss wielding the Thief Blade. It connects the danger to the Demonomicon, which it hints at how to destroy and what lies within it.
	- One interpretation: There is a plot to kill the Emperor, and if the Demonomicon is destroyed then there will be no way to stop the Abyssal assassin.

## The Campaign:

>[!tip] Character Tracker
>**Orcus:** Track down the Thief Blade + grow vampire cults in the Cycladene church. Has loose manipulation over Zagyg
>**Fraz:** Groom the Crew to help him escape, sew chaos in the City. Has strong manipulation over Zagyg
>**Zagyg:** Track down the Thief Blade
>

1. The Crew finds Fraz, disguised as Yrah, in the Godtrap beneath the Tower. He says he's been trapped here by his father, Zagyg, for being the only being able to challenge his power. Fraz begins to ally with the party, trying to get them to free him. He tells of the prophecy, and begins training Rabbitouille

>[!tip] Character Tracker - After prophecy
>**Orcus:** Reveals a way to destroy the Demonomicon! Move on Prismeer to defeat Tasha.
>**Fraz:** Wants to recover his Staff - now knows how! Continue grooming Crew - move them towards Mordenkainen.
>**Vecna:** Prophecy grows Vecna's paranoia. He deals with Fraz, asking for the secret in how to destroy the Blade. Fears that the Demonomicon will be destroyed. He wants to keep it safe. Helps Tasha hide Prismeer? Provides shadow guards?
>**Zagyg:** Closer to recovering the Thief Blade; use evidence recovered by Crew to locate the Blade.
>**Tasha:** Demonomicon's destruction makes Tasha paranoid. She hides Prismeer.
>
>Other entities:
>**The Bank:** Prophecies predicting the end of the Empire is bad for business. Start a propaganda campaign to any who have heard this news that the prophecy is entirely speculative.

2. Crew recovers the Thief Blade and free Fraz from the Godtrap with Mordenkainen's help.

>[!tip] Character Tracker
>**Orcus:** Fraz is free and the Thief Blade is lost -- this is horrible news. Orcus tells Zagyg to track down Fraz and recover him. Orcus will also dedicate his own resources to finding Fraz and the Thief Blade. Rilan makes contact with the Crew, scouting out their abilities.
>**Fraz:** Now that he is free, Fraz can more easily slip around the city and sew discord. He reveals Orcus's minions in the Cycladenes by slipping info to his servants in the Myriad. He replaces Jeffers and points Crew towards Prismeer.
>**Vecna:** Fraz escaped, and will soon deliver the Thief Blade to Vecna's hands!
>**Zagyg:** Fraz escaped, and still has Yrah. Zagyg, furious, will track Fraz down and kill anyone in his way.
>**Tasha:** Tasha does not know that Fraz escaped. She has cut off contacts.

3. Crew settles in with Mordenkainen

>[!tip] Character Tracker
>**Zagyg:** Destroys the Obsidian Citadel and the Circle of Eight. Tracks Crew to Leomund's Hidden Lodge, but flees and prepares to find Prismeer when Crew convinces him that Fraz went to find Tasha. Zagyg reports back to Orcus that he has a lead on Fraz and possibly the Thief Blade.

4.  Crew and Bank uncover that the Cycladene upper-echelons are connected to Orcus
>[!tip] Character Tracker
>**Orcus:** with his connections to the Cycladenes slowly being revealed, Orcus needs to move quickly if he wants to keep Khas a secret. He needs to prune his Cycladene cult, putting Khas on the side of the true Cycladenes.

5. Green magic potion stuff goes down.

>[!tip] Character Tracker
>**Fraz:** He weaves a plot with Dorthyza to get the Crew's attention and convincingly feign his deal with Vecna. This gets a little complicated, but the details don't really matter. Fraz sets up Dorthyza and the Green Magic potions as a way to get the Crew out to Prismeer so he can kill Tasha.
>**Vecna:** Fraz escaped, but he says the Thief Blade is bound to Leomund's Lodge. He'll need to recover Leomund from Dorthyza's prisons before he can unbind the Blade.

5. Crew kills Adnan, taking his place on Council of Brother's Company

>[!tip] Character Tracker
>**The Brother's Company:** Valandor Sef, a rakshasa working for Fraz, wants to continue escalating the conflict in the City. Adnan was innovative, but increasingly influential and troublesome. He welcomes Maximo, but does not yet give him power in the Company until he knows his stance. Valandor wants to continue the conflict by working with both sides in the war -- which Adnan stepped against.
>**The Cycladenes:** The Cycladenes have been forced to use mercenaries because of the sheer volume of forces put forward by the Myriad. They attempted to wrest control of the mercenaries, but this fell through with Adnan's assassination.They are losing the war, and are forced to make a choice. 1. They shouldn't make an enemy of the mercenaries, but it is by the manipulations of the current leadership that the war is serviced. The Cycladenes can attempt to run their own manipulations, supporting Elara the Giantess and unseating Valandor Sef.

**Elaborated goals and motivations**

*Vecna*
Vecna began as a mortal sorcerer, but he turned to the dark arts as a means of conquest. 
Vecna has been searching for a way to be free of Fraz for millennia. For this endless time he's learned all the darkest arts--and created more. He has raised an army of evil and concocted the most vile of all spells. He has become the first arcane Lich, tied to his master's Demonomicon. Still he searches for a way to be free--though he knows lichdom alone will not solve it. Only by recovering his Heart can he be free, and only by the wills of Fraz himself or using the power of the Abyssal Staff can he enter the Library of Hearts. The Abyssal Staff can only be recovered if he is killed--a sacrifice he is willing to make if his killer will free his Heart from Fraz's Realm. He can only hope to make a deal with those that confront him: he must fight them under the Domination of Fraz, but he begs them to recover his Heart from Fraz.
Vecna is dominated and ordered not to betray Fraz.

*Tasha*
Handling the Demonomicon and spending hundreds of years studying the Abyss has corrupted Tasha to the point of no return--but only to that point. She stole the Demonomicon and ran off with it in order to keep her demonic powers away from civilization. For over a century she committed atrocities as the Witch Queen of Perrenland, Natasha the Dark, Iggwilv, Hura of Ket, and other names. She first summoned Grazzt, thinking she could coerce him into aiding her in defeating the other Demon Lords. In this she was right, but she ended up falling in love with her prisoner--and he with his captor. She was alienated from Zagyg, though there was not much of his former self left. Tasha and Grazzt's relationship brought down Demogorgon and several other demon lords, even weakening Orcus himself. But, in a moment of weakness--perhaps intentionally--Grazzt was able to escape. He imprisons her for a time in Azzagrat, but she is freed. She sets up Prismeer, where she continues her work of imprisoning the last of Fraz's enemies. Above it all, what poisoned her and Grazzt's relationship was her unwavering secrecy about Fraz and the motivations behind her hunt. She will maintain this secrecy to any end, for the sake of saving her son.

*Zagyg*
The Mad Wizard has perhaps gotten the worst end of Fraz's deceptions. Tasked with guarding the King of Demons, Zagyg's constant presence around Fraz led to a permanent mental injunction with Hollow's Heart that has driven him into a deep insanity. Besides his insanity, though, it has given him the deepest understanding of the Prince of Deception's realm.

*Grazzt*
He simultaneously loves and hates Tasha--and he'll do anything to help her defeat Fraz. He wants to see the Demonomicon destroyed--after all, it's a powerful weapon against him. He also wants to see all of Fraz's plots unravel before his eyes. For now, though, he still needs to uncover Fraz's plots.

*Guire, Eres, and Bash*
Guire works to preserve life and fight for Asfalon, so he wants to help the Crew if they fight for good. He is the Aspect God Haere. He, as the enigmatic patron of the land, protects the PCs in disasters and on journeys.
Eres wants to return and become the most powerful person, master of all realms and the arcane. An old manifestation of her, Sashas, is returning in a Renaissance of magical learning. Despite this, she also created the Aurhal Autochthon of Cathorin. Eres worked with Vecna to develop dark magic, but she also acts as the patron and consort to Mordenkainen, as he is very likeminded with her.
Bash hates Eres and Guire and Selor. He wants to corrupt everything they do, and if that means destroying all life--so be it. He, through the Thief Blade, will push the user towards slaughtering Orcus and allowing the demonic invasion to occur. He wants to see Vecna killed, Mordenkainen killed, all of them.

*Mordenkainen*
Orcus's "plot" has been known to Mordenkainen for some time--at least since Yrah and Muck and Serten went to the Abyss. However, Mordenkainen didn't act then and he won't act now, at least not for the "good of the world". He believes that magic of his power must remain neutral. He is so arrogant that be believes himself to be a god-like force. However, he is secretly in love with Tasha and will act to protect or save her. Of course, canonically, Mordenkainen changes his ways and places himself as the ultimate arbiter, exiling Vecna and all of Touchstone.

*Bank of Miros*
Fraz knows that the significance of history and conflict forges heroes. He wanted to raise the conflict in the Empire to spur on the generation of the Crew, the great heroes that would kill Orcus for him. So, long ago, he stole the heart of Kasra Ishur and prompted him to split from the Duskivaines and grow the Bank of Miros. Fraz has been nudging the Bank this whole time as they started the religious war.
They, however, don't necessarily know this. To them, they are just a Bank:
If the world gets invaded by a demon horde, people will be less inclined to pay back their loans. This is unacceptable. If Orcus is planning to invade--he must be stopped. This Fraz guy? Whatever. Killing the Emperor? This would destabilize the government (in reality it will be so much worse), unacceptable. Eventually, the Bank might realize that the world is fucked. It goes into emergency mode: liquidate all assets. Close on all loans immediatly. Distribute magic items between its branches to use when it sets up de-facto local governments after the Empire collapses. Move on wholesale take overs, i.e. of the Incantators to monopolize magical powers for a possible warlord state.

*Orcus*
The Master of Death doesn't particularly want to invade the Prime Material plane. Sure, he wants all things dead and under his control eventually, but right now he's in a showdown against Fraz--not against the whole world yet. He is weakened, and so he is focusing on his revivification and finding his Wand. He's working primarily through the Cycladene Church, the upper eschelons of which are filled with his worshipers. This was, subtly, supported by Fraz's manipulations. Orcus gives power to the Duskivaines and receives power from them as well. Nystul and others are working on reforming Orcus's wand. Once he accomplishes these two things, then he'll make a move against Fraz himself. He is constantly watching for Fraz and waiting for signs of him to emerge. He tracked him to the Tower, but realized that he is far too well protected there to be attacked. When Fraz left the Tower and went to Mordenkainen in the Obsidian Citadel, Orcus saw it as an opportunity to strike at his enemy. Orcus entreats with Lolth to learn what he can about Fraz, and he tries to head Fraz off with his Cult if he can.

A - Orcus / Cycladenes strike at Obsidian Citadel
B - Fraz strikes at Obsidian Citadel
- right now, nobody knows that Yrah / Fraz left the Tower. Certainly not Orcus and the Cycladenes. Or would they?
C - Both? After the kidnapping of Dariush Ishur, the Cycladenes investigate and track the Crew. They infiltrate the Obsidian Citadel and find Yrah, prompting them to attack it under orders of Orcus. Publicly, this is warranted because Mordenkainen is harboring high fugitives of the law. Privately, this is to attack the Crew and Yrah. Yrah / Fraz takes this assault as an opportunity to get rid of Mordenkainen.

**Questions**

*How do you destroy the Demonomicon?*
The book was made essentially indestructible: its base, the Tome of Zyx, served as the phylactery to Vecna's soul. With its expansion into the Demonomicon, it could only be destroyed if six powerful demons who had escaped its pages each rent one sixth of the book within the six days that Vecna's body was destroyed before its rejuvenation.

*How does Fraz's domination work?*
The spell Dominate Person beguiles someone--it charms them into believing themselves to be Dominated. Fraz Urb'luu skips the middleman and simply dominates the target. So, no charm-ending effect could interfere with Fraz's domination.

*Why didn't Fraz dominate Zagyg and Tasha?*
Fraz realizes that dominating them would completely remove any ounce of deniability he has in his identity. Simply leveraging their son is, in a way, a more fool-proof plan.

*How does Fraz react to an attempted escape plot?*
Well, seeing as Zagyg's Tower is the safest place for Fraz to be, he doesn't really want to go anywhere--but he'll relish the opportunity to throw off Muck. He'll pretend to escape, all the while really sending a Rakshasa body double while he remains in the Tower. He was the one who brought the Crew down there in the first place to begin grooming them, but he wasn't counting on their stupidity in mentioning his imprisonment to Mordenkainen. If all goes well, the Crew will believe him rescued and Zagyg will continue to believe him imprisoned. If Zagyg believes that he failed in his task and thinks the real Yrah is in danger, he may snap.

*Why don't Tasha and Zagyg destroy the Demonomicon, recover the Staff, and free their son?*
Destroying the Demonomicon isn't that easy. It would take killing the Emperor and freeing all the demons that **despise** Tasha, fighting them off and taking the Staff for themselves--all without Fraz stopping them.

*What will Fraz do if his deceptions unravel and he is confronted?*
He'll first try to use a manipulative line to strike fear into the hearts of those that uncovered him: "Me? A demon? I ..." he feigns domination, "I'm controlled by one. What are the symptoms of demonic presence: creeping darkness. Check. Abyssal plants. Check. Insanity. Check. Why do you think Tasha left and started studying demonology? So she could exorcise the demon from her husband's soul. Why do you think I'm imprisoned down here? Why has he threatened to kill anyone who finds out about me? Because I'm the only one that could recognize him for a demon besides Tasha. Zagyg is Tower's demon!"

Or..."You're right. I'm a demon. But...I am not imprisoned here. This is a fortress I have constructed for my own safety. My home in the Abyss was attacked by Orcus, Demogorgon, and Grazzt. I escaped, and came here to work towards their downfall. Orcus is plotting to open a new Blood Rift to the Prime Material Plane, which would allow all of demonkind to flood into your City. I aim to stop him from achieving those goals."
If these partial deceptions don't stop hostilities towards Fraz, he'll next try to contain the leakage by assassinating anyone who knows about it with his rakshasas and shadows. If that fails and his identity becomes widely known (or at least known widely enough to get to Grazzt), he leaves his prison and leaves a powerful illusory/shapeshifted double. He himself will go and use all the leverage he's built up to hamstring the powerful forces of the Empire (Mordenkainen, Zagyg, then Tasha). The Emperor will move on Prismeer and forcefully take the Demonomicon. Together, the Emperor and Fraz will use the Demonomicon to bind six Demon Lords. Once they do, they'll recover the Staff and attempt to move on Orcus.

*What events led up to Fraz and Orcus's rivalry?*
Uncounted years past, Fraz grew in power during the Second Abyssal Civil War that tore through the plane after the essentia of Mycelia and the Forges of Creation were devoured. At the time, the Pale Night ruled all the Abyss from Hollow's Heart wielding the powerful **Hollow Staff**. Fraz used the essentia he captured to create the **Last Word**, a vile curse, which he laid upon the Pale Night. The Last Word is a gossamer veil that covers the cursed being, destroying the demon and transforming it into an ephemeral power without ambition or consciousness. When Pale Night was cursed, Fraz stole the Hollow Staff and used it to divide the Abyss into two great Pillars connected by web-like bridge Realms. For millennia, Fraz ruled both Abyssal Pillars and grew more and more powerful. During his reign the Abyss began its injunction on the Three-Fold Glooms, and the first Tenari are created. Eventually, essentia from the Silent Halls and the Labyrinth form in the Infinite Fear and a Third Abyssal Civil War rages. Fraz's rule is challenged by the young Orcus, who claims the essentia and forges them into his namesake **Wand of Orcus**. Seeing the power of Orcus, Fraz sacrifices much of his control by branching the Abyss a second time, creating the Third Pillar. Orcus is satisfied for now, but the new Tenari demons are more ambitious and vile than ever, and the Abyss becomes steeped in internal conflict.
Eventually, as the history of the Last Nousant played out, Vanemer emerged into the planescape and created the Astral Web, connecting all the planes and opening the Heaven's Gate between the Abyss and Avernus. The Blood War begins, offering a means for demons to rise quickly to prominence or fall violently into ruin. The Blood War waxes and wanes, recently waning as a Fourth Abyssal Civil War wracks the plane with conflict. New essentia had formed within the Infinite Fear, and the greatest Demon Lords vied for the power they offered. Orcus sought another means of increasing his strength and sealing his superiority over Fraz: he hunted down the lost Pale Night, enveloped by the Last Word. He attempted to bargain with the former Queen of Demons and win her over to his army, but she tricked him and ripped his soul away from his body, devouring it and assimilating it unto herself. The Last Word possessed Orcus's body, but the Master of Death was not so easily defeated. His soul battled with the Pale Night and regained a delicate dominance. He bested the Pale Night and controlled the Last Word, though its presence beside his soul began to slowly degraded his being. Orcus now controlled two great artifacts: his Wand, and the Last Word. Orcus resents the trap laid by the Pale Night, and he seeks to quickly claim the Abyss for himself before freeing himself of the unhallowed power of the Last Word, or at least cure himself of its debilitating effects. With the Last Word under his control, he formed a demonic alliance with Demogorgon and Grazzt and made an advance on Fraz's domain of Hollow's Heart.

*How did Yrah end up imprisoned?*
Zagyg was a part of one of the earliest wizarding groups in the Last and First City after the rise of magical education and the construction of Touchstone. He and his Company of Seven explored the Planescape--in fact, they were some of the earliest to do so. In their travels, they came face-to-face with some of the horrors of the Abyss and its inevitable march towards the Prime Material. They recover the Abyssal Tome of Zyx (written by Fraz himself and filled with deceptive rituals), which is inset with a shard of the Abyss itself to keep the tome forever up to date in its information. Zagyg and his partner, Tasha, have a beloved son: Yrah. Yrah joins an adventuring group of his own, the Circle of Eight. Yrah, always curious and mischievous, steals the Tome of Zyx from his parents and discovers within its pages a false plot by Orcus to invade the Prime Material. In his youthful zeal, Yrah and his friends enter the Abyss to confront Orcus. They fall into Fraz's trap, instead being teleported to Hollow's Heart and dominated by the King of Demons. Fraz makes a deal with Zagyg--that Zagyg would imprison Fraz and protect him, projecting a guise of forceful suppression. In return, Fraz would protect Yrah. And so the deal was made, and Zagyg and Tasha came under the influence of Fraz Urb'luu. On the very day that Orcus and his demonic alliance invaded Hollow's Heart, Zagyg summoned Fraz to the Prime Material and imprisoned him. Fraz disappeared from the Abyss in the blink of an eye.

*What happened in the Abyss after Fraz vanished?*
With the capture of Fraz, the demon hordes were handed off to Demogorgon, Grazzt, and the other Lords. The Fourth Abyssal Civil War exploded into furious slaughter. It took them some time to discover the existence of the Demonomicon: only when it is used by Tasha to bind Grazzt do the Demon Lords really take it seriously. Tasha used and manipulated Grazzt, and through him Tasha orchestrated a play on the most powerful Lords of the Abyss. An attack on Orcus himself was first, using Demogorgon and the powerful drow Kiaransalee as weapons. The attempted assassination brought Orcus low, destroying his body. The Master of Death rose as a great shade, and he unveiled the power of the Last Word, instantly killing Kiaransalee and weakening Demogorgon. In his weakened state, Orcus retreated to the depths of his Realm to recover his Wand, which was lost in the attack. With Orcus temporarily out of the picture, Grazzt worked with Tasha against Demogorgon. Together they bound him in the Demonomicon and *imprisoned* the book in a demiplane so as to never let Demogorgon possess Tasha. In this momentary success, Grazzt escaped, but his freedom came at the cost of one century in Azzagrat. Grazzt changed in the clutches of Tasha--he loved her, and he hated it. In his imprisonment he learned that much of what Tasha knew--or at least what got her started--was given to her by Fraz. Finally, the King of Demons had resurfaced. But where? Grazzt plotted against Fraz and worked towards his own freedom. As he was being pulled back into the Abyss, Grazzt dragged Tasha with him, binding her in an Abyssal demiplane for a time before she was rescued by the demon-wizard Tuerny. In his freedom, Grazzt is focused on trying to find Fraz and control, or destroy, Tasha's Demonomicon.

*What was Tasha's timeline?*
 Over the last 200 years, Tasha worked to understand the Abyss and its denizens better than anyone else. She discovered the true names of many of Fraz's enemies and how to summon them, and she bound many of the most powerful demon lords within the pages of the Dark Tome.
215 Years ago - Tasha and Zagyg write parts of Demonomicon
185 Years ago - Tasha is corrupted and runs off. Witch queen of Perennland, when she summons Grazzt.
160 Years ago - She summons and binds Grazzt to learn more. Demonomicon is expanded. She binds Tsojcanth, spawn of Fraz, a half-fiend.
155 Years ago - Tasha and Grazzt plot against Orcus, weakening him into Tenebrous.
150 Years ago - Tasha and Grazzt plot against Demogorgon, which ends with Demogorgon captured, but an Abyssal injunction that was created could only be closed by binding Tsojcanth to it. This was done, but allowed Grazzt to escape.
150 Years ago - Grazzt is freed, Tasha is imprisoned
50 Years ago - Tasha is freed by Teurny in exchange for her help in destroying Grazzt. Tasha agreed, though she doesn't really want to confront Grazzt again. They're like icy-hot.
50 Years ago - Tasha founds Prismeer.

*How does Muck play into all this?*
Muck is the pin that binds Fraz to the Crew. Muck is the key to the Crew's grooming, and in fact is the reason that they are the Crew at all. Fraz has deep knowledge behind the metaphysics of the Planescape. What he learned he learned from Infinity the Perpetuant. The most important point is that Fraz has a basic understanding of simifixes and the importance of history. He knew that his plans would result in a simifix--in fact, he counted on it. He needs a simifix to raise heroes of the caliber of defeating Orcus. Muck is the seed of those heroes, and a seed that Fraz can control. He sent Muck away just before the sack of Hollow's Heart with the eventual goal of returning to the Prime Material plane to join the mercenary group that would discover Fraz and become the heroes to defeat Orcus. Muck served as the seed for many of Fraz's props: the Orcus cult in Stardale.

He wants to build their trust. Sending the Crew deeper into Muck's story will reveal that Muck can be controlled--and that he was likely controlled by Fraz.
Things to be revealed about Muck's story:
1. His heart was ripped out by Fraz.
2. He is controlled by Fraz.
3. Hollow's Heart was sacked by an alliance headed by Orcus
4. Muck and Yrah were sent away before this.
5. ??

*What's the canon ending?*
Fraz's plots are uncovered by Mordenkainen and the Circle of Eight, who first move against his servant: Vecna. They fail when Fraz intervenes. The vampire lord Kas is destroyed after he uses the Thief Blade recovered by Zagyg to sever the hand and eye of Vecna. Halmadar, servant of Vecna, kills the archmages of the Circle of Eight, save Mordenkainen, who exiles Vecna and Touchstone to the plane of Ravenloft before escaping himself into the Planescape. The Empire collapses. Zagyg and Tasha confront Fraz and destroy the Demonomicon, freeing Fraz's enemies in order to defeat him. In the chaos, Zagyg is killed and Tasha uses the Abyssal Staff to infiltrate Hollow's Heart and free Yrah and Vecna's Hearts. Tasha tries to hide away, but, after a short crisis, the demons are banished back to the Abyss by heroes led by Yrah using the Crook of Roa.

*What would be the Crew's "best good guy ending?"*
The good guy endings really rely on whether or not they want to try to free Yrah and Fraz's other slaves. This would require them destroying the Demonomicon and releasing the Lords of the Abyss to fight another day.
Alternatively, they go for the "greater good" scenario. They kill Fraz or imprison him in the Demonomicon along with the other Demons and hide them away, ridding the world of their scourge. If Fraz isn't on the same plane of existence as the Emperor, then he can't exercise his domination--then, to finish the job, they could kill the Emperor. This part is more optional, but the Emperor will try to destroy the Demonomicon if he can--so he'll have to be subdued.

*What's the best "bad guy" ending?*
They help Fraz or Orcus. Fraz's ultimate goal is to gain ultimate power and control the Planescape. His rule will not be very nice. Orcus doesn't even want control. He simply wants everything dead, and thus, under his domination. Helping either of these two Demon Lords will lead to a pretty evil ending.

*Why haven't Zagyg or Tasha wished Yrah free?*
Wish, as a spell, has not yet been written. It needs to be discovered. Perhaps the Crew can do this.
