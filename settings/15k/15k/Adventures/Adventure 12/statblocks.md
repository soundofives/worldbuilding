## Mummification Chamber
All mummies have resistance to non-magical damage. The Guardians have a Dreadful Glare (DC 11 Wis), Warding Hex (7 damage on melee hit), and cause mummy rot (DC 12 CON). They also have a final curse (DC 12 Cha).
The devoted has a Final Curse on the creature that kills it (DC 18 Charisma).

**Strategy:** if in combat, the cultists attempt to forcefully mummify the Crew. The mercuric censer smoke pretty much fills the room, meaning all damage sources get more extreme. This does affect the cultists, but not the minions (they are only killed by attacks and failed saves).

The Devoted will attempt to Charm the first Crew it can get close to after the first attack. If it can successfully charm someone, it immediately tries to use Needling Imperative. If the creature breaks out of the Needling Imperative, the Devoted will resort to Erode Will and get the person close to the dissecting tables. Then it will try to use its Night's Caress on another target, or on the first if it can't get its charm off.
Once a creature is charmed or asleep, the cultist minions usher it/drag it to the embalming tables and set it on. If two or more cultists work together to grapple, they can use group attack rules and cause a restrained condition. They'll hold the target down on the table while as many cultists as possible use their artful incisions to kill the target--this bypasses Temp HP so is great for Charmed targets.

The Fanatic Mummies attempt to protect the Embalming process and the Devoted. They try to create a warding blood symbol as fast as possible, so they gang up on a character to do that. Once they have a glyph, once uses its Unshackled Sensation power. If a creature destroys their blood glyph, they try to stun them and use them to make another glyph. If they've got an active glyph going, they try to wail on creatures that seem the most problematic.

## TANORIAN VAMPIRES
![[Pasted image 20240129091135.png]]


## Vampire weaknesses and Powers
- wooden stakes (1d4+STR)
- resistance to radiant, weakness to necrotic
COMMON WEAKNESSES
- burned by salt - salt cast as an action (5 ft cone, as burning hands), deals 1d10 fire damage and prevents HP regen
- repelled by holy symbols - If a creature the vampire can see uses its action to brandish a holy symbol *it believes in*, the vampire must succeed on a DC 15 Wis save or be frightened until the end of the creature's next turn.
	- - A frightened creature has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on [ability checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_4) and [attack rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_32) while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	- The creature can’t willingly [move](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_9) closer to the source of its fear.
UNCOMMON WEAKNESSES
- charmed by well-written poetry - if a creature uses its action to read a religious poem (Sashas religion check DC 15 or deception DC 20) written to the vampire, the vampire must succeed on a DC 15 wisdom save or be charmed by the creature for the next minute or until the creature is hostile to the vampire.
- the vampire can only be killed by intense and specific mutilation. All the vampires limbs must be removed, its heart must be cut out through its back with a weapon of alloyed gold, lead, silver, steel, and cinnabar while incapacitated, and all parts of the body must be immolated.
POWERS
- Disadvantage on AoO -- supernatural speed
- Regeneration - the vampire regains 20 HP at the start of its turns. Salt stops this, necrotic damage stops this.
- Devouring Soul - creatures slain by the vampire cannot be resurrected while the vampire is still alive.
- Poisonous blood - a creature that deals slashing or piercing damage to the vampire must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute, repeating this save at the end of every turn.
	- Poisoned: disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks

Vampire Dreadknight

## Suryastra
*Weakened by five millennia of imprisonment, Suryastra's body is blood-starved and desperate for freedom.*

Movement: 50 ft, 90 ft fly
Black wings of an angel (90 ft fly speed)

#### Thief Blade:
+1d10 to initiative
+11 to hit,  22 (4d6+9) slashing on hit, or 33 (4d6+2d10+9) slashing against arcane casters.
Extra die of weapon damage from brute, extra from artifact

**_Limited Magic Immunity._** The Suryastra can't be affected or detected by spells of 1st level or lower unless she wishes to be. She has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.
(~60 - 100 dpt, which is enough to take out about 1 PC / 1-2 rounds if she JUST attacks. Along with her grasping strike and charm, she'll probably avg out to 1 PC / turn. They'll really need to be on their game.)

**_Numinous Presence._** If the angel has at least 172 HP, a creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the angel must succeed on a **DC 12 Wisdom** saving throw or be unable to take hostile action against the angel until the beginning of its next turn. A creature passes this save automatically if it took damage from the angel since the end of its last turn.

**_Wrathful Presence._** If the angel has 171 HP or fewer, a creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the angel must succeed on a **DC 12 Wisdom** saving throw or become Frightened of the angel until the beginning of its next turn.

***Blood Starved***. Until Suryastra feeds on blood, she cannot use her multiattack.

**Tanorian Regeneration**. regenerates 20 HP at the start of her turn.

**Holy Blood**. Upon being dealt slashing or piercing melee damage, AND after feeding, Suryastra's blood sprays out, poisoning the attacker. A **DC 15** CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute (disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks) and can attempt a new save at the end of every round.

**Inspire Fury** . Creatures charmed by Suryastra have resistance to non-magical damage and treat all creatures except her as hostile.

### Suryastra's tactics:
Suryastra starts slow. She attempts to charm the most aggressive enemy, letting it run wild on its allies while she flies 30 feet up and observes how they react. She'll rely on her Numinous Presence here, which casts a ground presence in a radius of 50ft instead of 60ft. She'll go ahead and run a second charm against the next most aggressive member of the attackers. If someone is resisting her Numinous presence, she kites with all three attacks of her Thief Blade, always trying to retreat to about 30 ft up. She reserves her legendary actions for Leaping Strike (45 feet) and Blood Drain against creatures that beat her Numinous Presence. If her charmed creature breaks free, she either attempts to re-charm it and crush its throat or Legendary action grasping strike then crush its throat on her turn.

She is arrogant towards spellcasters, trusting in her immunity and resistance to protect her from most attacks. If a spellcaster pulls out a high level spell, she'll turn her focus towards them, using her Thief Blade's extra damage towards spell casters and closing the initial distance with her Leaping Strike.

She knows about her vulnerabilities--if any creature utilizes salt or radiant damage to stop her regeneration, she targets them with her Leaping Strike and Blood Drain.

If a creature reads poetry to Survyastra as an action (cannot be done if affected by **Numinous Presence**), she has to make a **DC 23 Wisdom save** (about %30 chance) or be **Dazed** (until the end of her next turn) and **charmed**. Because Suryastra-Bash can understand all languages, it does not need to be read in Cryptic Tanorian. She does not use her Legendary Resistances to prevent this until she's bloodied.
**While Dazed, you experience the following effect:**
**Limited Activity.** You can Move or take one Action on your turn, not both. You also can’t take a Bonus Action or a Reaction (AoO) or Legendary Actions.

If she succeeds on the save, she will target the creature that read the poetry. If she is charmed, she will attempt to protect that creature and attack anything that gets close to it. She'll move down to the creature, then she'll use her attack action to trade 8 attack for 8 AC, making her essentially unhittable (AC 26). *She doesn't get to re-roll the Charm save, so this is a good way to protect one character who is getting beat up hard and allow them to heal up.*
Once Suryastra is bloodied, she begins using her Legendary Resistances against future poems OR if the Crew is using this to DEVASTATING results, Suryastra claws her ears out and becomes immune.

Things the party can use to help them:
1. Poetry!
2. Salt (stops her regen!)
3. - repelled by holy symbols - If a creature the vampire can see uses its action to brandish a holy symbol *it believes in*, the vampire must succeed on a DC 15 Wis save or be frightened until the end of the creature's next turn.
	- - A frightened creature has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on [ability checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_4) and [attack rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_32) while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
