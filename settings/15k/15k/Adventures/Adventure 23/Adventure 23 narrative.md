Continuation of 22; seeking out the source of the potions.
Source of potions: the beholder Dorthyza seduced the fey consort Cailana away from her master: the fey witch queen of Bleakwood, Solodovnika. The Incantator Naz Bahar went out into the planes to follow his master Leomund, who had gone out to explore. He found his master: imprisoned by the behold Dorthyza! When Naz Bahar tried to free him, he came under the domination of Dorthyza and was corrupted. Cailana and Dorthyza together dug through his thoughts and mind and discovered a quite profitable venture within the Last and First City: potions! Someone else had already begun this, however the market was ripe for competition.

Adnan's letters and correspondance:
- Valandor -> Adnan, Dariush is on board with the plans. Funding will be provided.
- Valandor -> Adnan, a spot will open up soon in the council of Guild Majors. It seems Selene is retiring.
- Adnan  believes Selene is imprisoned somewhere, he doesn't believe everything Valandor or the others say.
- (6 months ago), Gadovan acting strange. Found out that Prismeer vanished--his old tutor, Tasha, has dropped contact with him.
- Notes to himself, describing his paranoia. The GUild Majors don't actually like him...they're using him. He feels in danger. He believed he could trust Maximo, but even Maximo seems to be going behind his back now...
- Adnan hired a PI to look into Maximo before takin him on as a prodigy, but the PI wouldn't let it go, even after Adnan tried to bribe him away.
- To a publisher, "The Adventures and Glories of Maximo Octavio de Costa"

Valandor Sef - Bard, an eloquent older half-elf who serves as the de-facto spokesperson of the Brother's Company. With a silver tongue and a knack for persuasion, Valandor is generally on-deck to accompany the Guild's lawyers in ensuring favorable contract deals. Despite his smooth demeanor, he's known to harbor a shrewd intellect, a talent for manipulation, and a love for coin and power. His connections and network extends far beyond the Brother's Company.
	- Valandor's under-the-rug dealings generally revolve around sneaky ways to manipulate contracts and avoid lawsuits. Thus he is well connected with various Inspectors of Law around the City, as well as having some recent dealings with the former Archlord of Coin. The dealings with Dariush were minor, often in the early stages of Adnan's plans. They met together, devising the first secretive contracts between the Bank and the Brother's Company. Valandor saw Adnan as an ambitious upstart,
Elara - Barbarian, a fierce half-giantess imbued with their ancestral power. Elara commands through strength and ferocity, and her steely gaze exudes an aura of intimidation. She has an unwavering loyalty to the Company. She took over the leadership of the battalion while you were away. Elara often pushes back 
Karthain - Monk, dark elf, an unhinged and deeply morbid man, Karthain revels in the bloodshed promised by Hextor. All you really know about Karthain are the rumors circulated by the men of the Company--that he has heaps of parchment pages covered in the last words of the people he's killed, that he was a former Shynedar-Kai assassin before he turned his back on the Cycladenes, and even that he's made a pact with Visha, Shynedar, or Death himself...
	Karthain is the next newest member of the Guild Majors, put in place by Valandor a few years ago after Valandor got rid of a previous Guild Major.
Adnan Alisi - Paladin of Glory, human, formerly the rising star of the Brother's Company. Adnan replaced the previous Guild Major, the mysterious swashbuckler Selene, when she disappeared only a few months ago. Now, with Adnan dead, a vacuum once again opens in the leadership of the Brother's Company...
	- Adnan hungered incecently for glory, wonder, sex, and wealth. His desires led him to rise quickly in the Brother's Company, pushing his prodigy's battalion organization to Valandor to secure huge contracts and leverage the growing religious war in the City. Adnan was paranoid, and that got him wondering about the wider implications of his deal and how to ensure he continues his climb to the top. What did Adnan know? He knew that the Mercenaries are giving over some of their profits to the Bank. He speculated that this is because the Mercenaries wouldn't have any of their profits without the Bank's meddling in the first place--that they are somehow responsible for this whole war. He doesn't necessarily care, but it makes him wonder... Why? It's obvious. The Bank makes immense profits out of the war, just like the Mercenaries. Adnan, thus, respects the Bank and thinks of the churches in a condescending light. He holds himself as a genius among men, though he's really not all that smart. He investigated everyone that came near him--including Maximo and all the Crew. He was the one that set Jeffers on the Crew, even though Jeffers was a real Inspector of Law and actual took it upon himself to investigate the Crew and everything they did, feeding info on background and activities back to Adnan.
	- oblex spawn
Gadovan Rahimi - Sorcerer, a high-fey who grew up in Bleakwood, a man whose arcane talents never fit in with the Incantators or the magical Universities. Gadovan felt the academic life was too slow and limiting, and he never felt at home in the industrious halls of the Incantators. He is drawn to power and influence--exactly what the Brother's Company offers. He yearns for the hidden knowledge brought back by so many of the adventurers in the Company, seeing his position as an opportunity to further his own learning and ambitions.
	- A graduate of Prismeer, taught by Tasha. He is an abberant mind sorcerer, a worshiper of the Wandering Stars. He is particularly reverent of Khirad, Hadar, and Delban. Gadovan Rahimi is not his original name, but its what he uses now to fit in more while he is disguised as an elf. He desires power most of all, so that he can return to Bleakwood and elevate himself there beneath the light of the Wandering Stars. Or, better yet, he calls the Stars to Asfalon...

1. There are other important figures as well, such as the key lawyer for the Company: Mazen Tahiraj, a well-regarded master of the legal arts. Mazen is an undead, formerly a _Shubtu-Hukra_, an Inspector of Law, in Touchstone.

Adnan was a deeply paranoid man. In search of money, sex, and fame he stumbled upon much more. He had gotten to the top of the Company after the disappearance of Selene.

The others, Gadovan, Karthain, Elara, and Valandor are all corrupt in some way. Valandor is a rakshasa placed there by Fraz in order to fascilitate the religious war, which is Fraz's simifix catalyst. Elara and Selene were quite pure, and recently Selene had been getting in the way of the growing simifix. Valandor displaced her soul into the Border Ethereal. Her body is kept in a closet in the Brother's Company guild hall. With Selene gone, Elara could be bullied into supporting the expansion of the war. The battalions. Elara is perhaps the most pure among them, but even she is susceptible to money. She has a guilty conscience, and she has a deep feeling that somethign bad happened to Selene. Adnan was sort of in on it, though he didn't know too much. He had spoken before with Valandor, and insinuated that it would be much easier with Selene gone. He doesn't know exactly what happened to her, but he believes her to be imprisoned somewhere. He believes that she was the only person will the strength to fend them off. Adnan was brought in to support the battalion structure.

With Adnan dead shortly after his promotion, the Guild Majors are suspicious, but they're not overly worried about it. Adnan was new blood, a political piece promoted to serve as an easily accounted vote in guild dealings. They understand Maximo's value: he's the true mastermind behind the battalions, and so they don't want to kill him and lose out on whatever other things he can contribute. Valandor knows that Maximo is valuable to Fraz, and so he is very willing to add Maximo to the Guild Majors on the condition that he expands battalion usage. Valandor admits that Adnan went too far with the Cycladene contract. They can guarantee the Cycladenes a battalion or two, but they can't guarantee that the Myriad would be cut out. That's not what mercenaries do. They don't play favorites. If Maximo reveals that he killed Adnan, then he is congratulated.

The Guild Majors meet and call Maximo to them, asking what he knows about the death of Adnan. His Crew was at the party, and there were strange magics rumored to have taken place. Some say that the only people that did not seem affected were the Crew. What happened?
If Maximo doesn't speak up for himself, then the Guild Majors dismiss Maximo to deliberate on a replacement for Adnan. Valandor expects Maximo to want the position, but he feigns surprise if Maximo nominates himself. He's served the Company for years now, quickly climbing ranks. He's served as the prodigy of Adnan for almost a year as well.
He's proven himself. He's quite worthy. Allowing him to sit on the council of Guild Majors will let Valandor keep an eye on him, and perhaps become his new mentor, guiding him towards the goals of Fraz. He'll be allowed to sit on the Council, but he won't be given a chance to vote.
"You were lucky to have a patron such as Adnan Alici. Not all are fortunate enough to meet someone so willing to help their prodigy grow."

Traditional Guild Major promotion: 


### Borlaw

Borlaw meets them at the Warehouse.

>*"I have bad news and good news. Which do you want first?"
>"Good news: My superiors have decided not to get rid of you yet. I convinced them that you'll still be useful to us--and that you'd have more discretion in your actions in the future. I hope that's true."
>"The bad news: recognize this?" - He pulls out a potion that looks similar to yours, but it lacks the deep, seductive depths and glittery allure that yours have. Instead, it pulses with a wild power, drawing you in through sheer curiosity. "These have been making their way around the streets. *

Quest: Stop the spread of these competitors!

The Competition is a Beholder named **Dorthyza**. He's based out of an astral hideout through the Wildring; near to Solodovnika's fey court of Bleakwood. He seeks wealth, power, and influence, and he's been told of a potion scheme. He's begun to imitate it, first seducing and charming several fey imposters, incantator planar travelers, merchants, guards, etc. He stole away a consort of Solodovnika,  **Cailana**, with promise of freedom from Solodovnika and wealth in the city. He's also stole several of her imposters, also through convincing, which annoys her. She is the Archfey from which Leomund got his Staff of the Woodlands, and so she can speak through it once it re-enters the material plane. The Incantator working for Dorthyza is **Naz Bahar**, an old and accomplished incantator who was once an apprentice of Leomund. He went to seek out his old master, tired of his life in the city, but was caught and charmed by Dorthyza.

Cailana is the main brewer of the potions, or at least she came up with reverse-engineering the potions of the Crew. She taught a small horde of XXXX to brew the potions in Dorthyza's lair, his **Isle of Dreams**. The secret ingrediant is Dorthyza's **eye ichor**. The eye ichor component can be reverse engineered with several weeks time and a few nature/arcana checks. This also reveals fey magic input. Cailana herself heads the Fey Imposter operation in Dragon's Rook. She is protected by the New Tanore druids, who don't know fully about her operation. She is under the guise of a pilgrim.

Dorthyza is running his operation by using his Fey Imposters to get through the Wildring Gate. There have been a string of guards acting strangely around the Gate, as the imposters have taken their place--occasionally, the guards return with memory loss. The Imposters cover themselves magically with Nystul's magic aura. If someone tries to use Identify on them, they'll panic and try to run, stealing some bystander's likeness when they get in a crowd to escape.

The New Tanore druid Circle, the **Hefsansarak**, or the Totem Keepers, are an egalitarian group that interfaces with the Bureaucracy to govern the city. They ensure natural influence on all things, though allow the Urban concepts of commerce, people, etc, to exist in harmony with their protective rites. They are very protective and traditional, ritualistic and safeguarded. They take pilgrims of the Land, and their HQ is in a totemic grove in the center of the city, split over the chasm. Tree-branch bridges connect the two sides. Pilgrims who come to them have annonymety, unless they say otherwise. Entrance into the grove is strictly forbidden for those carrying iron-based metals.
	Archdruid of the Hefsansarak: **Heiydark**, an ancient druid. His spokesman is **Nidal**. 

The potions are slowly spreading around, sold for slightly under the Crew's prices in order to cut customers from them. (45 gp). Cost is offset via slave labor. They are thus sold to the wealthy bankers, high guild members, entrepreneurial businessmen, master thieves, mercenary captains, and others of high-society in the city.

The potion fluid is moved from the Isle of Dreams to a warehouse in Dragon's Rook for bottling and distribution. Naz Bahar uses **Geas** on a Hauling guild thief, **Zara Bakalli**, in order to help with distribution through Gates. Zara works alongside the Hauling family, the **Veliu**, who control the Dragon's Rook -> Touchstone lane. The Veliu are recently Sessessionist from the Bank, though originally they were Reformist. This faction comprises those who want to break free from the Bank/bureaucracy's control entirely. They argue for independence from the empire's trade regulations, with the intent to operate on their own terms. They often have secret contacts within the bureaucracy who sympathize with their cause. Through Zara, as part of the deal in moving these potions, they've been given several Helmed Horrors as guards.

Veliu manor is not huge. The family is prominent, but they are not insanely wealthy. They have a small collection of very old magic items, including a Lifewell mask, an item purchased from an archon long ago. It adheres to the face while attuned.
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:lifewell-tattoo
The mask is a Veliu heirloom, no longer worn but proudly displayed and even made a part of their heraldry.
The mask is on display in the Veliu grand entryway, protected by a simple alarm spell. The spell alerts the family's guards, 4 Helmed Horrors.
Other items of note:
Glamoured studded leather, bonus action to make the armor look like regular clothes, 13+DEX AC.
Both of these items are noted as major pieces of Veliu wealth in their accounting books, found in the study.
The armor is worn by the Veliu heir, Natasa Veliu. She works at the docks.

Naz Bahar also helps run a defense operation to not rely on mercenaries: outside of New Tanore, he buys mercury from merchant travelers to create Helmed Horror servants. He has many of these, but each one uses some of his HP. So killing them makes him stronger. This station of his is manned by a Simulacrum of himself. These helmed horrors stand watch over the Hauling guild shipments, disguised as city guards in veils.

If the Crew obviously begins messing with the shipments or looking into the stuff, Naz Bahar's simulacrum and a few Helmed Horrors go and try to intimidate them, choosing to do so in a crowded place where Naz can enchant innocents nearby. Naz tries to use the opportunity to slander the Crew, posing as forces of the Law.

## Archdruid Liana

If Mysto goes to Liana, she says that the Grove has a much needed respite. They can regain their strength, but they are still very much in need of allies and strategies to push back.
She promotes Mysto, giving him an aditional use of wild shape. 3/day now
## Uzaxuk

Uzaxuk has taken the realm of Baphomet, though he cannot fully devour the realm until Baphomet is truly dead. Now he is vanished, disappeared somewhere. He wants an empire of the Abyss and the Material Plane, but he doesn't think too much about the details. Right now, there are several other powerful demons rising to fill the vacuums left by Tasha. He is battling them, but his eyes are on Orcus too. For now, he wants Carric to spread his name and his promise for power. He wants Carric to give him an Empire, an Army--whatever it takes.
## Yrah

Now that the sword is bound to the Lodge, Yrah simply hangs out in it unless it's travelling. If it is travelling, he moves with the Crew. His goal is to keep studying magic, seeking info about new or rare spells around the city. He will still be Rabbitouille's patron, but now that he is free he can also teach/help Rabbitouille with enchanting items and casting spells, making spell scrolls, etc.

## Rilan

Rilan doesn't want the Crew to trust Borlaw. He acknowledges that he now sees that Muck and Maximo are working together, which is convenient. He extends an offer of partnership -- 

Notes from last time:

Polymorphe shop, run by Nadim, who is doing research in developing a battle standard for the Brother's Company.
The Standard is a modified Battle Standard of Infernal Power, which relies on a caged imp. This battle standard, which will offer soldiers heroism + wrathful smite will have a caged white or black dragon wyrmling. Dragons are the original mortals of Asfalon--planar dragons are remnants of old Nousants, lost in the planescape. Essentially, they live everywhere. The closest populous of black and white dragons are the cold swamps of Bleakwood.

## Through the Wildring

The Wildring is an astral injunction bridging the Feywild Courts and the Prime Material plane. Just beyond it is a stretch of the Astral Plane called the Thither and the Wildroad, a gorgeous expanse of land that seems to stretch forever, the view of it almost warped like a fish-eye lens. Once one travels into it, though, your mind adjusts. The area around the Wildring is dominated by Fis/Fos effects, which balance because of its frequent use. Generally, when one appears in a new place they feel a sudden drop in temperature, the dissolution or decay of nearby plants, or the sudden deaths of animals. Thus, when passing through the Wildring, it's usually advised to buy a cheap animal to bring along with, which will usually die instead of you.
When someone has left the plane through the Wildring, the air around will experience a hotflash, plants will grow, storms start, etc.

The Wildroad is commonly traversed by travelers. The Fis/Fos effects make any attempts at housing or business around the Wildring impractical, but farther down the Wildroad there is the famous Safelight Inn, a refuge that many travelers find when they are afriad. It's run by a pair of archons, a Hound named Barney and a Lantern Archon named Alfariel. They take in people looking for safety, and generally the inn has several refugees in it. She serves food, though it is only for comfort as food offers no sustenance here.

The Astral lands around the Fey Courts take on their appearance--wild, natural, yet unruled and without bounds. It grows Elemental, fundamental, when near a piece of the Unravelling. There are sometimes vast swathes of nonexistance set in the wilds of the Astral. Currently, the Astral planes around the Feywild are shone down upon by several Wandering Stars. Most notably now is Caiphon, drawn to the border of Asfalon and the Astral. The Astral plane is timeless.

Astral plane is created from the threads of Arangil, the space of Artifex. It is thus only matter, timeless, formless, and traveling through it is a matter of will and thought. Navigation here is done with Insight rather than Survival.
Distance, time, etc are fluid here. Spells might last forever. Long casting times can be shortened. All people can make checks to let them bend the Astral space--letting them fall wherever they want. Essentially allows misty step but with damage if you're not careful. 

Terrains:
Prime Material
Feywild

A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas,
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this
powerful force.
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes,
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal
in a few rounds.
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers
journeying together suffers the same location effect.
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to
determine the location and mental effects.

## Shinfting Court of Arcturiadoom

To get through to Bleakwood, one only needs to pass through the edges of Arcturiadoom. Caiphon-influenced mutant Boggles try to mislead them though, drawing them closer in to Arcturiadoom by switchign road signs, felling trees, pickpotting, etc. They will offer to lead the party as guides, though they will simply guide them further into Arcturiadoom. A simple crossing takes 3 days -- every day, there's a chance that the Crew can meet hobgoblins, star spawn, hobgoblins, fire giants, etc. Each of these are mutated in some way by Arcturia. The land itself polymorphs according to her whims and unconcious wills.

Danger:
Clay that transfigures a person trapped in it. The boggles love this trap! They'll mold you into the opposite gender, or add funny features -- large nose, ears, etc.
