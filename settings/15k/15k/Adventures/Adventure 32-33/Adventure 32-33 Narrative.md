31 got to Dorthyza, 32 was killing Dorthyza

33 is after -- looting the castle, dealing with Meiddraden, finding Leomund, and fighting the angels that seek the Wand of Orcus.

With Dorthyza dead, his half-dreamed shades still wander the castle on autopilot. Slowly they will fade into nothingness, and they're not hostile.

## Orcus
Orcus will try to use Rabbitouille to figure out where the Thief Blade is. As of right now, he sees Rabbitouille as an enemy token that he's temporarily gotten control over. He doesn't reveal his full plan yet, until he knows for sure that Rabbitouille can be controlled. Also, he doesn't know for sure if Rabbitouille is being manipulated by Fraz -- he doesn't want to reveal too much if all his plans are going to get back to his enemy. Orcus will offer his typical things -- power, eternal life, return of lost loved ones, etc, in exchange for knowledge. He will give Rabbitouille the use of Orcus's Wand if Rabbitouille tells him where the Thief Blade is -- Insight check is +12. If the location is revealed, Orcus will be suspicious -- Fraz wouldn't let the Thief Blade far from his reach. Orcus will ask about Yrah, who he believes is separated and on his way to Tasha.

## Meiddraden

Meiddraden's challenge: if asked about Leomund, Meiddraden will smirk and challenge the Crew to a bet. He'll release three sequestered beings from within his gemstone necklace (as Imprisonment) temporarily -- an old man, an angelic prince, and a hag. As a reward for defeating Dorthyza, the Crew can choose to release one prisoner from the Menagerie.

**The Old Man** - by the name of Barrabas, a 
**Prince** - aid them in dissuading the planetars / evading heavenly justice
**Disguised Hag** - aid them in navigating the Feywild ; will give hints as to safe passage through a Realm.
**Leomund** - can aid them with a free Plane Shift

Meiddraden loves to tell stories -- and he loves heroics as well. With Dorthyza dead, Meiddraden will take over the Isle of Dreams and turn it into his lair. However, he still must deal with the Crew.
He loves to tell stories -- not really to make new ones or to experience them. He believes all stories to be in the past, and that the present is finished and boring. He also isn't enraptured like Dorthyza about listening to stories -- he just falls asleep.

If the Crew approaches him, he will simply talk to them -- if they try to interrupt or ignore him, he'll grow angrier and angrier. He will attack to teach the Crew a lesson, but not to kill them.


# To the Feywild

If the Crew confronts Cailana, she'll suggest her debt repaid. She will return home to Hyrsam's Forest. If the Crew wants to join, she'll allow them to follow her -- but she won't promise guidance unless a gift is given in return.

She'll tell the Crew a bit about the Feywild -- but she wants to keep herself useful, and won't reveal too much. In the Isle of Dreams, she has several  (5) Skindancers with her in Dorthyza's tower.

Otherwise, she'll 



"I will protect you in sickness and in health"
"Hyrsam's forest will be your home forever more"
"You will be my fathers son"
"We will protect me on long vacations through the planes"
"We will make frequent long vacations to see your family"
