Party brutally confronted the Young Devils at the Wretched Crow Tavern. After slaughtering many of the gangsters, the rest escaped, heading back towards the Chapel of the Cycladenes that acts as their HQ.
As they were running away, a Shynedar-Kai assassin walked from the tavern and warned:
>[!quote] Assassin
>"It seems you and I both seek the same quarry, but to different ends. Your friend and his kidnappers have committed a great sin, and they will face Shynedar's wrath. Stand in my way, and I will be forced to kill you."

### Young Devil HQ

The Young Devils hunker down in their abandoned chapel HQ. They set up their defenses and wait to see if they were pursued. If they were, they take some actions:
1. Azi takes Hasur from the Sanctum of the Twins and flees with 4 gang members into the sewers, which have an access point just behind the Chapel.
2. Little Lonny defends the Chapel for a few minutes to give Azi time to escape, then he orders the others to scatter into the dark. If anyone attempts to pursue Azi, Little Lonny takes a small gang (4) and chases the pursuers.
These actions are taken if the Chapel is confronted at any time. If the Young Devils have time to Long Rest, they set up traps in many of the easy-access windows and doorways of the chapel. They regroup back up to 12 goons and 2 leaders, though Azi and 4 goons flee, leaving Little Lonny and his 8 goons to defend the Chapel. They try to be evasive, not confrontational, luring the PCs into traps and attacking them if restrained.

>[!warning] Traps
>Net Trap: **DC 15 to find, DC 15 to disable**; affects all targets within a 10 ft. square area, DC 10 save or become restrained, setback
>Arrow Trap: **DC 15 to find, DC 10 to disable**; +4 to hit against one target, 1d10 piercing damage; heroic tier, setback


### The Shynedar-Kai

The Shynedar-Kai are actively working to kill the heathens that forsake the Sanctum of the Twins. They will do anything necessary to kill all the Young Devils and Hasur. They'll first scout out the Chapel stealthily, noting of traps. They realize that the PCs can do much of the heavy lifting. They'll appear to the PCs before any confrontation and talk to them, but they'll stand by while the PCs take damage before moving in to help finish off the rest of the Young Devils. One of the two Shynedar-Kai goes off to kill and round up the Young Devils that scatter at the end of combat, the other pursues the heretics in the sewer, which they noticed in their scouting.
### Sewers

Azi knocks Hasur out and drags him into the sewers. The goons help carry the man, but their progress is slow. If they are pursued immediately, they don't get far and can be confronted quickly. If they get some distance away, (5-10 rounds of combat), an Easy Skill Challenge ensues.
If they are given the full 10 rounds of combat to escape, chasing them is a Medium Skill Challenge.

>[!tip] Sewer Skill Challenge
>**3 Failures** or **3 Successes (Easy) / 5 Successes (Medium)**
>>*You're starting a skill challenge, another important aspect of confrontations in my game. Skill challenges are when you want to accomplish a difficult goal that might have time constraints that isn't easily covered by combat rules. Some example skill challenges: chases and pursuits, quick and dangerous escapes, accomplishing a complex non-combat goal, etc. In a Skill Challenge, to successfully accomplish your goal you have to make a series of skill checks to make progress or to avoid obstacles. If you fail too many skill checks, you fail the Skill Challenge. In all Skill Challenges, failing **3** skill checks will result in failing the Challenge. The number of successes you need will determine how easy or hard the Challenge is. In some cases, there are ways to undo or avoid failure--but it might cost you. In this case, the party needs to get **3/5 successes** in total before you get **3 failures**.
>>Anyone can make skill checks in challenges, but **you can only use skills that you're proficient in**. Also, **each player can only try a skill once**. For example, if you use Athletics to jump across a gap, you can't use Athletics later on in the Challenge, you'll have to find another skill to use. In Skill Challenges, you can also cast spells or try an attack roll. You can only try an attack roll once, like will skills, but you can use any number of spells.
>>As we go through the Skill Challenge, you'll take normal skill rolls and Obstacle skill rolls. Both can result in a success or failure, but an Obstacle is something I deliberately throw at you. Example: a normal roll would be like, "I want to use Investigation or Insight to see if I can find a shortcut." or "I want to try to use Intimidation or Persuasion to get the crowd to slow down the enemy". An Obstacle skill roll would be like, me: "You turn the corner and are faced with*

>**Obstacles**
>1. Otyughs blocking the passage! They can be tempted with an item to move out of the way, you can try to squeeze by them quickly, sneak by them, find another way around, etc.
>	1. Failure means the Otyughs grapple you and slow you down--this failure can be mitigated with a DC 13 athletics or acrobatics that don't count against your skill checks.
>2. A huge Gelatinous Slime bulges out of the sewer canal in front of you
>	1. failure to deal with it will mean getting engulfed and taking 10 damage. A DC 12 strength check will escape the Cube a few seconds later, but the failure isn't negated. An ally can help pull you from the Cube (DC 12 Strength) and take 10 damage to negate the failure.
>3. The gang of Young Devils is catching up on you! They reel around a corner behind you and start slinging stones to slow you down.
>	1.  failure means their stones daze you! You hesitate and lose time. This obstacle will repeat until dealt with!

>5. The Shynedar-Kai throws caltrops!

The Mountainglades want nothing to do with Hasur now--their point was already made. They will attempt to talk Azi down into freeing Hasur--but Azi has lost too much at this point. He and his few gang members he brought attempt to sack the Mountainglade House.

If the PCs rescue Hasur and want to escape and hide from the Shynedar-Kai, there is little hope. He is marked with Hunter's Mark by the assassin, but Muck can offset this with his talents in the Underdark. This can turn into another skill challenge!
