The Mountainglades are a wealthy human family headed by their patriarch Anwar.
**Anwar** passed his imperial examinations many years ago and has been serving as the apprentice to the Inspector of Taxes in his precinct. This is a prestigious position, and he is under the patronage of the Inspector, Sahar Vokolo. Sahar is very wealthy, and has connections to the Bank of Miros through the Malku.

Anwar's son, **Tarq**, is a jocky deadbeat. He is intelligent, having attempted to attend the Tower, though he learned little and blew a lot of money. Tarq hangs out with friends at a nearby plaza, generally getting up to no good.
This night, Tarq and his buddies are planning on mugging a Cycladene plaza caller, as he is a staunch Myriad worshipper. His family is not particularly against the Cycladenes, though they do worship the Myriad.

Anwar has a young daughter that lives in his home, **Lina** Mountainglade, 7 years old. She is learning the lyre, and looks like her mother, Nava.
