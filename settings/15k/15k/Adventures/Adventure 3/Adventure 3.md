Ransom of Hasur Highfallow, part 2.

Overview:
Party brutally confronted the Young Devils at the Wretched Crow Tavern. After slaughtering many of the gangsters, the rest escaped, heading back towards the Chapel of the Cycladenes that acts as their HQ.
As they were running away, a Shynedar-Kai assassin walked from the tavern and warned:
"It seems you and I both seek the same quarry, but to different ends. Your friend and his kidnappers have committed a great sin, and they will face Shynedar's wrath. Stand in my way, and I will be forced to kill you."

---

The Young Devils leader, Azi, takes Hasur and flees into the sewers, hoping to make it to a friendly dock to smuggle Hasur to the Mountainglade House, leaving his Lieutenant to defend the Chapel.

The Mountainglades want nothing to do with Hasur now--their point was already made. They will attempt to talk Azi down into freeing Hasur--but Azi has lost too much at this point. He and his few gang members he brought attempt to sack the Mountainglade House.
