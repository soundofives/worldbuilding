# Through the Wildring Arc Summary

>[!summary] Arc Summary
>This is a large arc - likely 10 adventures or so, taking us up till Christmas, spanning levels 11 - 15. The Crew is presented with a few small goals:
>1. Meet with the Beholder Dorthyza and discuss the merger of their potion business -- or end Dorthyza's competition entirely.
>2. Paid by Inspector Jeffers, the Crew should follow Zagyg's Tower and find the long-lost Prismeer.
>3. Decide whether or not to drag Cailana back to her captor Solodovnika in exchange for a **wish**.
>   
>This is likely the order the Crew will choose as well -- they can reach the Isle of Dreams directly from the Astral Plane, though they'd need to travel through the Feywild to find Prismeer and Solodovnika. The last two are kind of interchangeable.

### Fallout of the Grand Revelry

The Crew's party at the Grand Revelry was truly a great success. People died, yes, though Maximo's speech at the end alleviated all the damage of the deaths. The grand expense gives the Crew +5 renown to all factions.

The tactical strike by the Orcus followers within the Cycladene Church perfectly sets up a schism within the Church. Kas heads the force against the Orcus worshipers, he himself hidden away as Orcus's single most powerful weapon. Despite his deception, Shynedar himself sees through his ruse. She raises The Rook as a secret agent against him.

The two feuding churches have made a delicate peace, healing the city at the fury of the Bank of Miros, which is imperiled by the decision.

The end of the Grand Revelry coincides with the beginning of the Adlicial Greengrass Festival and the holy day of Aryeh Tzavai, which celebrates botany, flowers, and springtime.


## Preparing to Leave

### The Hauling Guild

>[!quote]
>On Phillip's gondola, Carric's mother is there. *"Your father's gambling debts caught up to him. He's dead, which leaves you as the head of our family, or whatever's left of it at least.*

### Grove of Obad Hai

>[!quote] Liana
>Ceremony to raise Mysto's rank within the Grove of Obad Hai. He now has access to draconic and celestial forms.

### Borlaw

The Bank had promised funding for the Crew's trip into the Astral Plane.
They provide the Silver Cords, 2 potions of Supreme Healing (10d4 + 20), 3 Quartz Spell Gems (lvl 2 spells, requires attunement), Potion of Giant Strength (Fire, 25, + 7), 5 sending stones.

Borlaw also approaches Carric to speak to him

>[!quote] Borlaw
>*"Carric. What went down at the Grand Revelry changes things. With the Myriad and the Cycladenes negotiating a truce, my employers are changing subjects of their investments. Your ... tendencies to cause trouble of an otherworldly sort -- my employers are interested in growing your venture, yeah? Now, seeing as you may never return from this little trip of yours, I'd like to ask if you know the best way to independently expand or nurture the chaos that you've sewn."*

### Levistus

>[!quote] Levistus
>*"My servant. My champion. I have a quest to lay upon your shoulders. You are passing beyond your Realm into the Astral Sea. Here you should seek Iggwilv, Tasha the Dark, and learn of what became of the Great Lords of the Abyss. Then you shall seek to return them to their thrones, or, if they are dead, you shall seek to destroy the upstart Uzaxuk. These tasks are yours, and they will be so."*

### Meeting with Cailana

The New Tanore druid Circle, the **Hefsansarak**, or the Totem Keepers, are an egalitarian group that interfaces with the Bureaucracy to govern the city. They ensure natural influence on all things, though allow the Urban concepts of commerce, people, etc, to exist in harmony with their protective rites. They are very protective and traditional, ritualistic and safeguarded. They take pilgrims of the Land, and their HQ is in a totemic grove in the center of the city, split over the chasm. Tree-branch bridges connect the two sides. Pilgrims who come to them have annonymety, unless they say otherwise. Entrance into the grove is strictly forbidden for those carrying iron-based metals.
	Archdruid of the Hefsansarak: **Heiydark**, an ancient druid. His spokesman is **Nidal**. 

>[!quote] Cailana
>*"Before we go, you should take only what you absolutely need. You can hide nothing from the Astral, or from its travelers. Taking undue wealth will draw the attraction of more...unsavory...types. Though I don't know if we can really avoid it, seeing how much magic you possess.*
>
>*"Traveling through the Astral Sea is a pilgrimage for a reason. It is not a journey conquered by strength or endurance, but by force of will and mind. That's why we need these silver cords -- some of you wouldn't last a single day in the Astral if left untethered. These will bind you to me, your guide.*
>
>*"We'll travel tomorrow. The diviners have called for the first snowfall of winter here. That should open the Wildring. Until then -- prepare yourselves. Rest offers no solace in the Astral, and the winds can strip your mind raw. We'll find little resources there -- so bring everything you'll need for spells or defenses."*
>
>*"Also, buy some animals. 30 or so to be safe. Any time you cross into a new Plane you must be holding an animal."*

## The Promenade

As the Crew walks up towards the Wildring, their status in the City becomes apparent. Crowds line the frosted streets holding colorful flowers from the northern Spring Festivals, out of place in the winter of the south. Some shed tears, others hold out their hands, hoping that the touch of one of their heroes will grace their hands. The crowd is solemn, for even the common folk know that traveling Through the Wildring is a journey that many never return from.

>[!quote] Jeffers
>An overly large pack slung across his back, the Inspector meets up with you at the head of the promenade.
>*"Alright! Well then my band of hirelings, let's be off on this adventure of ours!"*

Borlaw -> commandeer Dorthyza's potion production or shut it down for good.
Jeffers -> find Prismeer by tracking down Zagyg's Tower
Solodovnika -> return Cailana for a wish.

Carric
Maximo

# The Wildring

The Wildring is a great circle of fantastical mushrooms, tall as houses and glowing in shades of dawn and twilight. As you enter the ring, you immediately feel the world around you begin to thin, wavering like a sheen of oil on water. As soon as you stand in the center of the ring, the silence of the solemn crowd transforms into a different silence -- one of loneliness. The floating mountains are gone, replaced by a thick impenetrable silvery fog, obscuring anything beyond it. Your minds are hazy, and you realize that...

>[!quote] The Astral Mantra
>**"You have no control over your body - until you begin to think. Desiring a destination, you find your feet moving, seemingly on their own free will, towards the jewel of your mind's eye."**

>[!quote] Cailana
>*"Now we walk. Follow me."*

# Encounters

**Social**
**Drifters** - you see a drifting Kenku (talks in phrases it has heard before) heading towards Asfalon, but drifting towards the Feywild. If he's (Furnace Door) rescued, he grants a bardic inspiration die (1d8) to everyone.

Planar merchants

Pilgrims

**Puzzle**:
A gynosphinx sits in wait at the transition between the Astral Sea and the Isle of Dreams -- it is Dorthyza's Guardian, and those who wish to enter must pass its test.

>[!tip] Riddles
>Thudnerous roar, rapid pace. Always running but yet stuck in place. Wide mouth that can not scream, laid in bed but cannot dream. - River
>I am the part of a bird that's not in the sky. I can swim in the ocean yet always be dry. What am I? - Shadow
>I never was, but always will be. I am never seen, yet always come. I carry nothing, yet hold much to some. - Tomorrow



**Combat**

Environment: a low grove surrounded by a 50 ft bluff on one side and a stream on the other. Shrubs surround the stream, but the environment is otherwise rocky and desolate.

(Extremely Deadly) **Gith pirates**
	The pirates first approach and ask for a toll - the most valuable magic items - goes from there
	- Two waves: first, gith raiders pounce and try to crit fish to cut silver cords. 2 Gish (CR 10) and 4 Mindslicers (CR 4) **24,300 (4,050/player)**
		- Mindslicers see Carric's Adamantine armor and focus their attacks on Mysto, Koshi, Maximo, and Rabbitouille. They break into teams of 2 for Koshi + Mysto first. The Gish focus on keeping Carric and Maximo busy.
	- If one or two cords are cut, they try to vanish as their Adult Red Dragon guard sweeps down and cuts a swathe of fire down the field.
	- The Gith pirates follow their prey for several days, trying to wear down the travelers. If one begins to Drift, the pirates move in for the kill:
	- 1 Gith Knight (CR 8), 1 Adult Red Dragon (CR 17), 4 Mindslicers (CR 4) **39,450 XP, 6,900 / player**
- Total XP: just under daily budget! 11,000 XP per player.
New total XP: 102,000 XP -- **Level 12 already**
 - If the Crew saves themselves from drifting generally, or they choose to push through to the Isle of Dreams, or the Mindslicers don't end up cutting a silver cord, then the Crew might be able to escape without fighting the second round.
- Crew can, in the middle, seek shelter:

### Safelight Inn

Safelight Inn, a refuge that many travelers find when they are afriad. It's run by a pair of archons, a Hound named Barney and a Lantern Archon named Alfariel. They take in people looking for safety, and generally the inn has several refugees in it. She serves food, though it is only for comfort as food offers no sustenance here.
- The Gith will attack the Inn, drawn by the power of the Crew's magic. The Innkeepers will shepherd refugees into the basement, but will inquire with the Crew what powerful magic they bear that has drawn such Gith pirates. If they find out the Crew is harboring the Wand of Orcus or are demon worshipers, they will grow hostile and try to summon Heavenly Judgement.

(Hard) Mindflayers - 1 Arcanist (CR 8), 3 Infiltrators (CR 7)
(Hard) 1 Astral Dreadnought (CR 21)

(Deadly) Orthon Bountyhunters - 2 Orthon Skullkeepers (CR 16) ; Devils after Carric as a worshiper of Uzaxuk and the Wand of Orcus
(Deadly) Heavenly Judgement - a Planetar (CR 16) and two Sword Archons (CR 11) ; Angels sent after the Wand of Orcus

### Psychic Wind
1d20 for each day traveling through the Astral - on a 1 or 2, the Wind happens.
A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas,
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this
powerful force.
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes,
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal
in a few rounds.
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers
journeying together suffers the same location effect.
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to
determine the location and mental effects.
