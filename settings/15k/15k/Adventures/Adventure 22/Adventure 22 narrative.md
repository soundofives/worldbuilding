Let's get back to some downtime and stability, setting the stage for Act 2.

Act 2 should cover the summer / fall; from levels 8 - 13/5

The Crew has acquired Leomund's Hidden Lodge, a new mobile secret base.
Fraz is using Rilan and Borlaw to steer the Crew against the Cycladenes and Orcus.

Meanwhile, the Bank is continuing to orchestrate the war between the Cycladenes and the Myriad as a simifixial catalyst. The war cannot go on forever though; the Bank knows this. What is their conclusion? They want to steal the entire wealth of the Myriad AND the Cycladenes. For the Cycladenes: force them into a tight spot; suggest they arm battalions with their magical items: their last line of wealth. Soldiers will get these weapons, but they will be addicted to Potion and become indebted. The Bank will acquire the magic items. For the Myriad; the wealth of the Myriad is more subtle. They crowdsource a lot more and have a lot less liquid capital to throw around. The Bank sees their mercenary contracts as the ideal. The fracturing of the Cycladenes is no problem; it will simply make them more volatile and likely to take risks such as arming mercenaries with magic items.
The Bank is cautious of the Crew. They don't trust them and don't like their unpredictability. The Bank thinks the Crew should be removed. Borlaw stopped them--but now they want to send the Crew on a built up suicide mission to both accomplish their goals of scaring the Church and also getting rid of the Crew. The Cycladenes are going to start sending out tough cookies: armed with magical weapons, large squads will put the Cycladenes in a good position. With the Crew teamed up with the Myriad or facing down the Cycladenes alone, it won't be long until the Crew has their money cut out for them. Throughout all this, the Bank will be cool and distant, manipulative and slowly moving in for the kill.
Borlaw will point the Crew on anti-Cycladene quests / pro-Bank quests.

Somewhat recently, essentially as of only a few months ago, a number of Cycladene higher-ups were assassinated and replaced by Fraz's rakshasas to take up worship of Orcus in tandem to their regular worship of Thesmata and Shynedar. Unlike the two Gods, the Cycladene bond with Orcus is more business and desperation than spiritual. This is extremely out of place for Cycladene worshippers--Orcus is very much outside their theological wheelhouse. As part of this move, Fraz is internally fracturing the Duskivaines. Some are not happy that others have taken up worship of Orcus...

As part of Act 2, the Crew can independently act, along with taking tasks from Rilan, Borlaw, or the Cycladenes themselves.
They've met some of the Cycladene's most intimidating members: Mirica Mirema, Dragana and Saira Duskivaine, and Nystul Duskivaine.
They've begun to toe the line with their allies as well: the Bank and Adnan Alisi. The Bank doesn't trust them, and Adnan has made a secret pact with the Cycladenes.
In addition, they have the impending danger posed by their former employer, Zagyg. While this is a phantom danger, Fraz is using it to keep the Crew under his heel. Fraz's simulacrum covered with Nystul's magic aura, still with the Crew...
Why does Fraz need Zagyg? As protection against Orcus.
Orcus isn't as brilliant as Fraz. He isn't always one step ahead. He realizes he needs to find Fraz, and he believes his shoe-in with the Cycladenes is a powerful position. How would you search for a disguised demon lord? He generally knows that Tasha is a powerful demonologist, and that she likely would know more. He would search for her first...but she's a tough cookie to find. Next he'd dig into Zagyg, but Zagyg kept pretty tight lips regarding Yrah in his prison. Mordenkainen knew because the Crew told him about Yrah. As soon as the Crew told him, he was as good as dead. Yrah knew he had to get rid of Mordenkainen, lest Orcus get more suspicious about Zagyg. Yrah has already killed Saamy and replaced her with a rakshasa. Orcus is suspicious of Zagyg, but is otherwise searching elsewhere.
Anyway; if the Crew is aligned against Zagyg, they likely won't ever go back and see that Yrah is right where they plucked him from. He's safe there, as long as his Simulacrum can stay hidden. The simulacrum can get replaced if he needs to, sneaking in and out in secret. Zagyg won't actually go looking for them: he will just be a prominent looming danger.

Rilan also rises as a figure in Act 2. Rilan is Fraz's servant; he wants to keep the Crew safe, generally, and wants to point them against Orcus. Rilan presents himself as a power hungry, ambitious figure who looks out for himself. "The City is going to shit--and I'm going to take what I can." type of attitude--how could he turn this against Orcus? Well, Rilan could be a bait-and-switch sort of guy. He wants Orcus's power. He sees the sword and says the Crew should use it to destroy Orcus. Rilan and Khasra... Khasra is actually a good guy. He'd turn against his lover and try to save everything from Fraz. He'd kill the Emperor, free the Demons, and destroy the Demonomicon so as to get at the Staff at its core to destroy it. This is it.
Rilan wants the Crew to take out Orcus with the Thief Blade, or at least get him close enough to do it. He will point the Crew on anti-demon quests.

Potential jobs:
2. A beaurocrat cabal of demon worshippers attempts to force an injunction with the Abyss, or perhaps they already did.  
2.1. Figure out how to close the injunction, and protect the gestalt while they perform the ritual  
3. The wizard needs spell components!  
3.1 Tasha and the school of Witherbloom have rival adventurers persuing the same creature.
4. One of the Universities in New Tanore is dealing with a surge in overgrowth related to a nearby druids grove.
4.1 Beaurocrats attempt to instate a new law that would clear cut the major districts of New Tanore.
5. The Cycladenes are Orcus worshipers--the only person who could help in understanding their demonic power is Tasha, who is missing. Where did she go?
6. Syndicate jobs! As a part of their overarching job against the Cycladenes, the Syndicate might have them doing jobs in return for their housing and protection:
   - Heists! Robberies!
   - Extortion! Protection Rackets!
   - Smuggling!
   - Information brokering!
   - Assassinations!

### Borlaw

Borlaw meets them at the Warehouse.

>*"I have bad news and good news. Which do you want first?"
>"Good news: My superiors have decided not to get rid of you yet. I convinced them that you'll still be useful to us--and that you'd have more discretion in your actions in the future. I hope that's true."
>"The bad news: recognize this?" - He pulls out a potion that looks similar to yours, but it lacks the deep, seductive depths and glittery allure that yours have. Instead, it pulses with a wild power, drawing you in through sheer curiosity. "These have been making their way around the streets. *

Quest: Stop the spread of these competitors!

The Competition is a Beholder named **Dorthyza**. He's based out of an astral hideout through the Wildring; near to Solodovnika's fey court of Bleakwood. He seeks wealth, power, and influence, and he's been told of a potion scheme. He's begun to imitate it, first seducing and charming several fey imposters, incantator planar travelers, merchants, guards, etc. He stole away a consort of Solodovnika,  **Cailana**, with promise of freedom from Solodovnika and wealth in the city. He's also stole several of her imposters, also through convincing, which annoys her. She is the Archfey from which Leomund got his Staff of the Woodlands, and so she can speak through it once it re-enters the material plane. The Incantator working for Dorthyza is **Naz Bahar**, an old and accomplished incantator who was once an apprentice of Leomund. He went to seek out his old master, tired of his life in the city, but was caught and charmed by Dorthyza.

Cailana is the main brewer of the potions, or at least she came up with reverse-engineering the potions of the Crew. She taught a small horde of XXXX to brew the potions in Dorthyza's lair, his **Isle of Dreams**. The secret ingrediant is Dorthyza's **eye ichor**. The eye ichor component can be reverse engineered with several weeks time and a few nature/arcana checks. This also reveals fey magic input. Cailana herself heads the Fey Imposter operation in Dragon's Rook. She is protected by the New Tanore druids, who don't know fully about her operation. She is under the guise of a pilgrim.

Dorthyza is running his operation by using his Fey Imposters to get through the Wildring Gate. There have been a string of guards acting strangely around the Gate, as the imposters have taken their place--occasionally, the guards return with memory loss. The Imposters cover themselves magically with Nystul's magic aura. If someone tries to use Identify on them, they'll panic and try to run, stealing some bystander's likeness when they get in a crowd to escape.

The New Tanore druid Circle, the **Hefsansarak**, or the Totem Keepers, are an egalitarian group that interfaces with the Bureaucracy to govern the city. They ensure natural influence on all things, though allow the Urban concepts of commerce, people, etc, to exist in harmony with their protective rites. They are very protective and traditional, ritualistic and safeguarded. They take pilgrims of the Land, and their HQ is in a totemic grove in the center of the city, split over the chasm. Tree-branch bridges connect the two sides. Pilgrims who come to them have annonymety, unless they say otherwise. Entrance into the grove is strictly forbidden for those carrying iron-based metals.

The potions are slowly spreading around, sold for slightly under the Crew's prices in order to cut customers from them. (45 gp). Cost is offset via slave labor. They are thus sold to the wealthy bankers, high guild members, entrepreneurial businessmen, master thieves, mercenary captains, and others of high-society in the city.

The potions are moved from the Isle of Dreams to a warehouse in Dragon's Rook for distribution. Naz Bahar uses **Geas** on a Hauling guild thief, **Zara Bakalli**, in order to help with distribution through Gates. Zara works alongside the Hauling family, the **Veliu**, who control the Dragon's Rook -> Touchstone lane. The Veliu are recently Sessessionist from the Bank, though originally they were Reformist. This faction comprises those who want to break free from the Bank/bureaucracy's control entirely. They argue for independence from the empire's trade regulations, with the intent to operate on their own terms. They often have secret contacts within the bureaucracy who sympathize with their cause.

Naz Bahar also helps run a defense operation to not rely on mercenaries: outside of New Tanore, he buys mercury from merchant travelers to create Helmed Horror servants. He has many of these, but each one uses some of his HP. So killing them makes him stronger. This station of his is manned by a Simulacrum of himself. These helmed horrors stand watch over the Hauling guild shipments, disguised as city guards in veils.

If the Crew obviously begins messing with the shipments or looking into the stuff, Naz Bahar's simulacrum and a few Helmed Horrors go and try to intimidate them, choosing to do so in a crowded place where Naz can enchant innocents nearby. Naz tries to use the opportunity to slander the Crew, posing as forces of the Law.

## Solodovnika

>*"Another hand touches my Staff. You are not the same whom I gifted this staff to...but you are in need of allies of the Woods. I can sense this of you. I can be such an ally, if you help me. Something very previous of mine was taken from me. I want it back."*
>
>*"A prized consort, my servant Cailana. She vanished from my realm several months ago, along with a number of my other servants. They are of no import; I only require Cailana returned to me. I believe she was taken to your realm, to the Last and First City."*
>
>*"Mine is the Court of Bleakwood, through the passage you call the Wildring, and beyond the Shifting Lands of Arcturia."*


## Archdruid Liana

If Mysto goes to Liana, she says that the Grove has a much needed respite. They can regain their strength, but they are still very much in need of allies and strategies to push back.

## Uzaxuk

Uzaxuk has taken the realm of Baphomet, though he cannot fully devour the realm until Baphomet is truly dead. Now he is vanished, disappeared somewhere. He wants an empire of the Abyss and the Material Plane, but he doesn't think too much about the details. Right now, there are several other powerful demons rising to fill the vacuums left by Tasha. He is battling them, but his eyes are on Orcus too. For now, he wants Carric to spread his name and his promise for power. He wants Carric to give him an Empire, an Army--whatever it takes.

## Levistus

Levistus sees the power of Maximo, and he wants Maximo to 

## Arinas

The Matriarch of Arinas, a hooded but mostly unrobed virgin priestess (oracle of delphi in 300) will commune with Koshi, asking him if he believes he has atoned for his past.

## Yrah

Now that the sword is bound to the Lodge, Yrah simply hangs out in it unless it's travelling. If it is travelling, he moves with the Crew. His goal is to keep studying magic, seeking info about new or rare spells around the city. He will still be Rabbitouille's patron, but now that he is free he can also teach/help Rabbitouille with enchanting items and casting spells, making spell scrolls, etc.

## Rilan

Rilan doesn't want the Crew to trust Borlaw. He acknowledges that he now sees that Muck and Maximo are working together, which is convenient. He extends an offer of partnership --
