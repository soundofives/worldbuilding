ACT 2:

The Crew has left the Tower and are taken in by Rilan and Borlaw as members of the City's Underground, the Thieves' Syndicate.

As part of this Act, they've begun their task of taking down the Cycladene Church: they've met some of the Cycladene's most intimidating members: Mirica Mirema, Dragana and Saira Duskivaine, and Nystul Duskivaine.
They've begun to toe the line with their allies as well: the Bank and Adnan Alisi. The Bank doesn't trust them, and Adnan has made a secret pact with the Cycladenes.
In addition, they have the impending danger posed by their former employer, Zagyg. While this is a phantom danger, Fraz is using it to keep the Crew under his heel.

Potential jobs:
2. A beaurocrat cabal of demon worshippers attempts to force an injunction with the Abyss, or perhaps they already did.  
2.1. Figure out how to close the injunction, and protect the gestalt while they perform the ritual  

3. The wizard needs spell components!  
3.1 Tasha and the school of Witherbloom have rival adventurers persuing the same creature.

4. One of the Universities in New Tanore is dealing with a surge in overgrowth related to a nearby druids grove.
4.1 Beaurocrats attempt to instate a new law that would clear cut the major districts of New Tanore.

5. The Cycladenes are Orcus worshipers--the only person who could help in understanding their demonic power is Tasha, who is missing. Where did she go?

6. Syndicate jobs! As a part of their overarching job against the Cycladenes, the Syndicate might have them doing jobs in return for their housing and protection:
   - Heists! Robberies!
   - Extortion! Protection Rackets!
   - Smuggling!
   - Information brokering!
   - Assassinations!

# Scene 1: Yrah, and a New Job

## Yrah

How did the Zagyg+Yrah v Mordenkainen battle go?
Mordenkainen has a contingency that he'll wish-destroy his Magnificent Mansion and suck everything into the astral plane if he's low on HP or in significent danger. This by-passes Forbiddance.
Mordenkainen has an avatar of Eres available to him
Mordenkainen has the **Circle of Eight**! Bigby was with Mordenkainen. Yrah tore Rary's heart out, and he killed Tenser and Otiluke. Drawmij and Otto were out at the time.
Zagyg can force **6** save failures!!! This easily sucks Mordenkainen's legendary resistances and forces a feeblemind and repeated madness blasts.

Yrah is a simulacrum disguised with Nystul's Magic Aura, and the sword he's carrying is a fake also disguised with Nystul's Magic Aura.

Well, after long thought, it seems like whatever conflict happens would be drawn out and devastating. There isn't any easy way to annihilate either party in a single round (Mordenkainen, Bigby, Tenser, Otiluke + Apprentices vs. Fraz, Zagyg, Rary), so such a conflict would go on for a while. Minions get pulled in, explosions happen, and in the end Mordenkainen gets Blasted with Madness to the point of a mild Feeblemind, at which point his contingency shunts half the Obsidian Citadel into the Astral Plane. Mordenkainen and Bigby are pulled in, and Bigby slowly sails the wrecked citadel to the Shadowlands and helps Mordenkainen recover.

Tenser, and Otiluke are killed. Rary fled. At the time of the assault, vampire lord Robilar was assaulting the mansion of Tenser and sacking it, killing Tenser's clones. This moment is a coup of the Qadashim Purifiers, which aids the Bank -- this turns a lot of eyes towards the Bank, even though they're not to blame for the attack.

>[!quote] Yrah
>
>Zagyg appeared out of nowhere -- he fought like a man possessed... it was terrifying. He fought four of the Circle of Eight along with me...we were barely able to hold him off. Mordenkainen is gone, pulled through the Rift with Bigby and half the Citadel. Tenser and Otiluke are dead... I tried to use the sword against him, but he put it into some sort of slumber--it hasn't awoken yet, it should be safe to hold until it awakens. Don't worry--I was able to resist Bash in the Sword.
>
>We pushed Zagyg to the brink of death--he'll come after us, but I think we're safe until he recovers. We need to find a secure place to hide--somewhere extraplanar where Zagyg can't track us.
>
>Mordenkainen told me of a secret place--I don't know where it is, but I have a hunch that . One of the wizards of the Circle of Eight, Leomund, created an extradimensional Hidden Lodge and left it somewhere when he left to explore the planes years ago. Even though Leomund left the Obsidian Citadel years ago, if there's anything left of his chambers we might be able to get a clue as to where he left the Hidden Lodge. If we can claim it, it could serve as a perfect hideout against Zagyg.
>
>I haven't regained my full strength yet, and fighting Zagyg fhas exhausted me further. I should wait out here and warn you if anyone else approaches the Citadel.

## Finding Leomund's Hidden Lodge

Before he went out to explore the Planes, Leomund of the Circle of Eight had created a fabulous and hidden extradimensional hideout with the help of Mordenkainen: Leomund's Hidden Lodge.
# Scene 2: Into the Obsidian Citadel

_Description:_ Yrah tells the PCs that he knows of a place they could be safe: an extradimensional hideout, "Leomund's Hidden Lodge", once created by the wizard Leomund, a prolific member of the Circle of Eight.

Geometry of the Citadel:

The Obsidian Citadel is ruined after the great fight between Zagyg and the Circle of Eight. During the fight, wild spells were thrown around, time was shredded, re-bound, and warped, magic saturated the Citadel and corrupted existing spell systems, and bystanders were corrupted and twisted.

Goal: reach Leomund's chamber in the upper part of the ruin

Challenges: Lower Ruin, Bridge 1, Middle Ruin, Bridge 2, Upper Ruin

Flying can help you avoid these levels, but the swirling mass of rubble and scraps of Zagyg's portals around the Astral Rift makes it dangerous! Plus the Astral Dreadnaught reaching through the Rift loves to snatch up flying things... His eye casts an antimagic cone!
### The Courtyard

1. **Main Courtyard:** The central hub of the Citadel, now an open-air plaza littered with debris and rubble from the collapsed towers and walls. A large crater marks the epicenter of the battle, surrounded by shattered statues and broken columns. The astral rift hovers above the courtyard, shimmering with ethereal energy. Separate, smaller holes in reality seem to flit and float through the courtyard, like scraps of paper.

The Main Courtyard shows that the Obsidian Citadel was (and somewhat still is) connected by a skeleton of magical pathways. The magical skeleton was the only thing keeping the blocks of the structure from falling after the rift opened in the middle and tore apart much of the Citadel. The courtyard is ruined and open to the air, the Astral Rift hovering above. As you get closer to the Rift, the courtyard falls away to lower levels : including what looks to be the remains of the Citadel's heart and a control sphere. Arcane focus can work to control the magical skeleton and reshape it, pulling the far pieces of the Citadel closer to the Courtyard.
	-Successful Arcana checks, increasingly difficult (**DC 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20**), can allow a user to re-shape hunks of the Citadel floating around the Astral Rift so that the Crew can reach the Upper Ruin where Leomund's Chambers are located.

### Hunks of the Citadel:

1. **Collapsed Tower:** Once a grand spire that housed the wizard's chambers and arcane laboratories, the collapsed tower now lies in ruins, its shattered walls and crumbling staircases forming a treacherous maze of debris. Hidden chambers and secret passages may still hold valuable treasures or dangerous secrets.
	- The Collapsed Tower is long and enclosed, making it a useful bridge, but it's filled with warped gravity, and you might fall all the way through it! (as reverse gravity, 60 feet!)

3. CHECK **Library Annex:** Adjacent to the main courtyard, the library annex once held a vast collection of magical tomes and ancient scrolls. Now, its shelves lay in disarray, with books strewn about and pages fluttering in the astral winds. Ghostly apparitions of spectral scholars roam the halls, forever trapped in their pursuit of forbidden knowledge.

- The Library's books are all cursed with minor versions of Symbol, which flit around when the Library is moved. Moving through it can trigger the books flying in your face, triggering their Symbols. Roll to randomly determine the effect.

4. CHECK **Alchemy Laboratory:** Tucked away in a secluded corner of the Citadel, the alchemy laboratory was once a place of scientific inquiry and experimentation. Now, it is a chamber of bubbling cauldrons, crackling vials, and swirling mists, where failed experiments and volatile concoctions pose a constant threat to unwary explorers.

	- The Alchemy lab is filled with Chronofog! It has the Disintigrated apprentices, defending themselves from an enemy no longer there
    
5. CHECK  **Collapsed Bridge:** Spanning a deep chasm created by the rift's passage, the collapsed bridge once connected two halves of the Citadel. Now, its shattered remnants dangle precariously over the astral void below, offering a perilous path for those brave enough to traverse its crumbling walkways and swaying ropes.
	- A few snow golems, partial Simulacrums, rise from the Bridge! Also, the Bridge has a Stone Golem! The Golems are stunned if the Astral Dreadnaught looks at them
    
6. **Ruined Chamber:** Here, the laws of reality warp and twist, creating strange phenomena and otherworldly vistas that defy comprehension.

	- CHECK One is A lightning rod, gets shocked and ignites with living lightning!

		- CHECK One is a room filled with Reality Break
		- ![[Pasted image 20240410095447.png]]
    
7.  **Relic Sanctum:** Concealed within the depths of the Citadel, the hidden sanctum is a refuge for those seeking respite from the chaos and destruction above. Here, forgotten relics and ancient artifacts lie undisturbed, waiting to be discovered by intrepid adventurers brave enough to brave its dark corridors and hidden chambers.

	- Has a Riftblade and 2 Frozen Volley!


-- The Basic idea is that the Crew has to split up: one caster can control the structures while some of the others run along the bridge he makes and fights some of the monsters. Meanwhile, the caster himself will be attacked by Killing Wards!

There are 7 rooms available to move and make a bridge. It will generally take at least 4 to make a bridge, but could take more if the big pieces are avoided. Also, getting too close to the Rift will have wild magic / Reality Break consequences!


>[!success] Loot!

### Leomund's Chambers

Half of Leomund's chambers are exposed to the Astral Rift, and the room is at 30 degree angle. Shit is everywhere. Investigation checks reveal:

**DC 10: Leomund's Hidden Lodge was left in Shada, it is disguised as a haunted house on the far side of Smithery Street, at the corner of Kaldar Road. The House is rigged with protective spells that will activate against trespassers ; Also, I captured and domesticated a number of Mimics to add to the fun!**

**DC 13: The House has a weakness that Leomund's hasn't figured out how to fix: In order for him to enforce its loyalty, he had to bind it to several objects of his. He chose sentimental objects: a painting of the Circle of Eight in the old days, an old emblazoned crest stamp, a small talisman of protection created by Tasha, Leomund's First Staff, and seems to get protective of these items. They could be used as leverage or could reveal emotional vulnerability. If such items were to be destroyed, the Lodge's loyalty may be re-trained.**

**DC 18:  At the heart of the Lodge is an ingenious, but amazingly dangerous, Prismatic Engine, a magical construct that imbues it with its permanent magic.**

4. **Unstable Magic Residues:** The conflict between the wizards has left behind residual pockets of unstable magic that warp reality and pose unpredictable hazards to anyone who ventures too close. The PCs must navigate through areas of fluctuating gravity, temporal distortions, or elemental chaos, requiring them to think creatively and adapt to rapidly changing conditions.
5. **Guardian Constructs:** To protect his sanctum during the battle, the wizards may have summoned powerful constructs or guardians infused with arcane energy. Now malfunctioning and unchecked, these constructs roam the ruins as mindless sentinels, attacking anything that enters their domain. The PCs must either destroy or bypass these constructs to proceed deeper into the Citadel.
	1. Magen (CR 1-3)
	2. Helmed Horrors (CR 4)
	3. Rug of Smothering (CR 2)
	4. Accidental Golems (Stained Glass, Partial Simulacra (snow golem), Flesh Golems, Stone Golem)
	5. Gutterspite Raggomoffyn (CR 5, controller)
	6. Living Spells (CR 1 - 11)    
6. **Twisted Experiments:** Within the shattered laboratories and libraries of the Obsidian Citadel, the PCs uncover evidence of the wizards' twisted experiments and forbidden research. They encounter mutated creatures, volatile alchemical substances, and arcane anomalies gone awry, posing both physical and moral dilemmas as they decide whether to contain, destroy, or exploit these dangerous creations.
    
4. **Fragmented Reality:** The intense magical energies unleashed during the battle have fractured the fabric of reality itself, creating pockets of distorted space-time and alternate dimensions within the ruins. The PCs find themselves navigating through shifting mazes of twisted corridors, parallel worlds, and mirrored reflections, where the laws of physics and logic no longer apply. They must use their wits and intuition to unravel the mysteries of these surreal landscapes and find a way back to the material plane.
	1. Reverse Gravity zone!
	2. Reality Break
	3. Antimagic field
	4. Control Weather
	5. Gate to Shadowfell
	6. Partial Simulacrum
    
5. **Echoes of the Past:** As the PCs explore the ruins, they encounter spectral echoes of the battle that tore the Obsidian Citadel asunder. Ghostly apparitions of the warring wizards and their allies replay key moments of the conflict, offering cryptic clues and fragmented memories that shed light on the events leading up to the battle and the fate of Leomund's Hidden Lodge. The PCs must piece together these spectral visions to uncover hidden truths and unlock the secrets of the Citadel.
	1. Apprentices killed by Disintigrate, but time stopped
    
6. **Corrupted Artifacts:** Amidst the wreckage of the Obsidian Citadel, the PCs discover a trove of ancient artifacts and magical relics tainted by the battle's aftermath. These corrupted artifacts exert a malevolent influence on those who wield them, twisting their minds and bodies to serve dark purposes. The PCs must resist the allure of these cursed treasures while seeking to cleanse or destroy them before they fall into the wrong hands.
	1. Library full of maddening books
    

By confronting these challenges and unraveling the mysteries of the ruined Obsidian Citadel, the PCs inch closer to uncovering the whereabouts of Leomund's Hidden Lodge and the secrets it holds within its extradimensional confines.

Here's an adventure map of the ruined Obsidian Citadel, with key locations and descriptions of how they connect to one another:

By navigating through these treacherous locations and confronting the dangers lurking within, the PCs inch closer to uncovering the mysteries of the ruined Obsidian Citadel and the secrets it holds within its shattered walls.


---

Certainly! Here's an updated adventure map of the ruined Obsidian Citadel, including Leomund's chamber and its connection to other key locations:

1. **Main Courtyard:** The central hub of the Citadel, now an open-air plaza littered with debris and rubble from the collapsed towers and walls. The astral rift hovers above, casting an otherworldly glow over the scene. Leomund's chamber lies hidden beneath the rubble, accessible only through a concealed passage in the courtyard's northern wall.
    
2. **Collapsed Tower:** Adjacent to the main courtyard, the collapsed tower once housed Leomund's private chambers and arcane sanctum. Its shattered walls now conceal the entrance to Leomund's chamber, buried beneath layers of fallen masonry and twisted metal. A secret door, activated by a hidden mechanism, grants access to the hidden depths below.
    
3. **Library Annex:** To the east of the courtyard, the library annex stands as a testament to the Citadel's former glory. Amidst the chaos of fallen bookshelves and shattered windows, a hidden stairwell leads down into the subterranean labyrinth, where Leomund's chamber awaits discovery by those who dare to seek it out.
    
4. **Alchemy Laboratory:** Nestled within the Citadel's western wing, the alchemy laboratory once buzzed with the hum of arcane experimentation. Beneath its cracked floors and scorched walls, a forgotten passageway winds its way towards Leomund's chamber, its entrance obscured by alchemical apparatus and bubbling vats.
    
5. **Collapsed Bridge:** Spanning the astral chasm to the south of the courtyard, the collapsed bridge offers a precarious path towards Leomund's chamber. Its shattered arches and crumbling supports serve as a harrowing obstacle for those who seek to cross the divide and unlock the secrets hidden within the Citadel's depths.
    
6. **Astral Chamber:** At the heart of the Citadel, the astral chamber pulsates with otherworldly energy, its walls shimmering with astral light. Beneath its arcane sigils and swirling mists, a hidden doorway leads to Leomund's chamber, guarded by ancient wards and protective enchantments that have remained dormant for centuries.
    
7. **Hidden Sanctum:** Deep within the Citadel's labyrinthine corridors, the hidden sanctum offers a sanctuary from the chaos above. Here, amidst forgotten relics and arcane artifacts, lies the final clue to unlock the secrets of Leomund's Hidden Lodge. Only those who possess the wisdom and courage to decipher its mysteries may uncover the path to their ultimate destination.
