## Naz Bahar and his Minions

Encounter: Naz Bahar and 4 Angry Mobs. He personally surrounds himself with a mob of 5 orphans (Commoner), which he uses to trigger Entreat the Masses. He attacks in a public place, so he can draw in additional Angry Mobs as part of his Infectios Charm or Compel Conflict actions. If Naz uses a person from the mob at any point (soulbound swap, Enchanted Resistance, etc) the mob loses 4 HP.
When he is personally attacked, he will use his orphans as targets for Entreat the Masses.
Flavoring Enchanted Resistance: the enchanted creature lurches infront of Naz and takes the brunt of the attack or effect, or blocks Naz to provide cover.
