The Cycladene Ball


>[!note] Overview
>The Duskivaine family is hosting a huge ball. The purpose is several fold: first, they want to get money from their wealthy aristocratic constituents. Second, they want to negotiate with the Brother's Company to sell the secrets to the Myriad's military organization.
>
>The Ball is attended by the wealthiest of the wealthy in the Last and First City: Duskivaines and Ishurs, Guild Masters, Bureaucrats, and others. Throughout the night, the Crew is being closely watched by rakshasa agents of the Emperor, who are orchestrating an attack on the ball alongside the Bank of Miros. If the Crew shows continued resentment to the Cycladenes, the attackers will accuse the Cycladenes of worshiping Orcus. If the Crew shows a change of heart, the agents will prompt Dragana to announce her belief that the Myriad are Orcus worshipers.

Fallout:

In the chaos, the Archlord of Coin, Dariush Ishur, was kidnapped. It was obvious that Rabbitouille turned them invisible before going to save Dragana. Their ally Maximo fought off the Myriad agents--but their other ally, Mysto, made an attempt on Dragana's life and was aided by the Myriad cleric.

So...from the outside, whose side is the Crew on? One attempted to kill Dragana, two attempted to save her. Another kidnapped a prominent Bank official and Ishur family member. Possibly--just maybe--the druid was truly attempting to save her.
In any case, the Bank is furious--the person they spent centuries maneuvering into the position of Archlord of Coin is dead by the hands of the mercenaries they trusted with a job of hamstringing the mercenary groups and lawyers.

A clandestine meeting with Borlaw and a Bank necromancer -- a "mind scraper", Cirus?? -- they want to question the corpse of Dariush Ishur, who they have long suspected to be a Cycladene double agent.
Dariush, like all archlords, has a Clone that was created when he took up his position. Now that the Bank has had the opportunity to question his corpse and reveal his betrayal, they can effectively predict the Clone's motivations and control him.

The Crew's actions need to be explained. The Bank understands that, generally, they would be expected to either stand by or  They also now have the opportunity to infiltrate the Cycladenes themselves....

Dariush Ishur was alive, awaiting his position as undead. Those in positions like this have clones to safeguard their saved position. So Dariush is not really in any danger here--except there is now a race between the Cycladenes and the Bank to acquire and destroy his corpse.
The Bank thinks the Crew is too volatile to be left active -- they need to be taken out. Even better, arrested.
The Cycladenes believe the Crew were definitely acting to attack them, but had to pivot to save face when they realized they were inadequate.
Yrah is afraid that Mordenkainen and Eres will discover a way to destroy the Thief Blade -- so he takes them out.
Yrah has made his move against the Cycladenes -- he sees that the Crew has chosen them as their favoured enemy, so he and Rilan are beginning to work to take Cycladene hearts and plant agents of Orcus. Rilan / Yrah will give the Crew their final job : dismantle the Cycladene cult once and for all.
