Continuation of 22; seeking out the source of the potions.
Source of potions: the beholder Dorthyza seduced the fey consort Cailana away from her master: the fey witch queen of Bleakwood, Solodovnika. The Incantator Naz Bahar went out into the planes to follow his master Leomund, who had gone out to explore. He found his master: imprisoned by the behold Dorthyza! When Naz Bahar tried to free him, he came under the domination of Dorthyza and was corrupted. Cailana and Dorthyza together dug through his thoughts and mind and discovered a quite profitable venture within the Last and First City: potions! Someone else had already begun this, however the market was ripe for competition.

## The New Potions

The Competition is a Beholder named **Dorthyza**. He's based out of an astral hideout through the Wildring; near to Solodovnika's fey court of Bleakwood. He seeks wealth, power, and influence, and he's been told of a potion scheme. He's begun to imitate it, first seducing and charming several fey imposters, incantator planar travelers, merchants, guards, etc. He stole away a consort of Solodovnika,  **Cailana**, with promise of freedom from Solodovnika and wealth in the city. He's also stole several of her imposters, also through convincing, which annoys her. She is the Archfey from which Leomund got his Staff of the Woodlands, and so she can speak through it once it re-enters the material plane. The Incantator working for Dorthyza is **Naz Bahar**, a middle-aged and accomplished incantator who was once an apprentice of Leomund. He went to seek out his old master, tired of his life in the city, but was caught and charmed by Dorthyza.

Cailana is the main brewer of the potions, or at least she came up with reverse-engineering the potions of the Crew. She taught a small horde of red caps to brew the potions in Dorthyza's lair, his **Isle of Dreams**. The secret ingrediant is Dorthyza's **eye ichor**. The eye ichor component can be reverse engineered with several weeks time and a few nature/arcana checks. This also reveals fey magic input. Cailana herself heads the Fey'ri skin dancer operation in Dragon's Rook. She is protected by the New Tanore druids, who don't know fully about her operation. She is under the guise of a pilgrim.

Dorthyza is running his operation by using his Fey Imposters to get through the Wildring Gate. There have been a string of guards acting strangely around the Gate, as the imposters have taken their place--occasionally, the guards return with memory loss. The Imposters cover themselves magically with Nystul's magic aura. If someone tries to use Identify on them, they'll panic and try to run, stealing some bystander's likeness when they get in a crowd to escape.

The New Tanore druid Circle, the **Hefsansarak**, or the Totem Keepers, are an egalitarian group that interfaces with the Bureaucracy to govern the city. They ensure natural influence on all things, though allow the Urban concepts of commerce, people, etc, to exist in harmony with their protective rites. They are very protective and traditional, ritualistic and safeguarded. They take pilgrims of the Land, and their HQ is in a totemic grove in the center of the city, split over the chasm. Tree-branch bridges connect the two sides. Pilgrims who come to them have annonymety, unless they say otherwise. Entrance into the grove is strictly forbidden for those carrying iron-based metals.
	Archdruid of the Hefsansarak: **Heiydark**, an ancient druid. His spokesman is **Nidal**. 

The potions are slowly spreading around, sold for slightly under the Crew's prices in order to cut customers from them. (45 gp). Cost is offset via slave labor. They are thus sold to the wealthy bankers, high guild members, entrepreneurial businessmen, master thieves, mercenary captains, and others of high-society in the city.

The potion fluid is moved from the Isle of Dreams to a warehouse in Dragon's Rook for bottling and distribution. Naz Bahar uses **Geas** on a Hauling guild Iron Fist thief, **Zara Bakalli**, in order to help with distribution through Gates. Zara works alongside the Hauling family, the **Veliu**, who control the Dragon's Rook -> Touchstone lane. The Veliu are recently Sessessionist from the Bank, though originally they were Reformist. This faction comprises those who want to break free from the Bank/bureaucracy's control entirely. They argue for independence from the empire's trade regulations, with the intent to operate on their own terms. They often have secret contacts within the bureaucracy who sympathize with their cause. Through Zara, as part of the deal in moving these potions, they've been given several Helmed Horrors as guards.

- The Bank, via Borlaw, has given the Crew permission to punish the Veliu's for their secessionist behavior.

**Zara Bakalli** is an experienced Iron Fist smuggler. She is adept at disguises as well; she used a disguised of an old hunched man when delivering the warning to the Crew. She isn't very welcome in New Tanore, which is generally territory of the Tongues.

Naz Bahar also helps run a defense operation to not rely on mercenaries: outside of New Tanore, he buys mercury from merchant travelers to create Helmed Horror servants. He has many of these, but each one uses some of his HP. So killing them makes him stronger. This station of his is manned by a Simulacrum of himself. These helmed horrors stand watch over the Hauling guild shipments, disguised as city guards in veils.

- Naz's simulacrum was destroyed in his attempt to intimidate the Crew and turn the general populous against them. He works on creating a new simulacrum while he sends his Helmed Horrors after the Crew if they continue meddling in Dorthyza's business.

If the Crew obviously begins messing with the shipments or looking into the stuff, Naz Bahar's simulacrum and a few Helmed Horrors go and try to intimidate them, choosing to do so in a crowded place where Naz can enchant innocents nearby. Naz tries to use the opportunity to slander the Crew, posing as forces of the Law.

Zara Bakalli posted a warning to the Crew--which they immediately blew through, capturing the courier and making a move at the Veliu family. Zara wants to draw them away from the Velius while Naz attempts to recuperate the damage done to the potion's reputation at Adnan's mansion. Zara sees that they robbed the Veliu's -- she will aid the investigators in finding the Crew, trying to get them in legal trouble to get them off the back of Dorthyza's operation.

- The investigator was intimidated by the Crew, and he gave up his sketchbook to them. Jeffers asked the Crew about the crime, and they said they met the investigators but no longer had the mask.

Naz will try to move against the Crew when they're in a public, open place--like a market, street, etc, but not somewhere crowded with city guards. Naz will be posing as a Myriad monk, 
4 City Guards (bunched up as a large swarm) will try to step in and arrest everyone involved in the riot, and Naz will try to charm them.
He prefers this first plan:
If he meets them in New Tanore: He's main line of preaching calls to the ideals of Arinas, Bahumat, and Valthor -- all calling for moral upstanding, purity, charity, etc. He reveals to the masses that the Crew are deceitful opportunists, greedy opportunists, fat and wealthy--grown in such wealth on the backs of unpaid slaves!

If he meets them in Sinisa, outside the Warehouse: he calls to the ideals of Thesmata and Shynedar. He calls for moral upstanding, purity, charity, etc. He reveals that the Crew are deceitful opportunists, greedy, grown fat and wealthy on the backs of the unpaid.
He has some crowds charmed, but other bystanders may not be explicitly charmed.

- With the first confrontation finished and failed, Naz has a better idea of the Crew's strengths and weaknesses. Cailana also gets on their tail. If the next confrontation ends in the Crew being subdued, Cailana will offer to let the Crew live if DOrthyza can buy their company out: 10,000 gp if they cease all production forever.


## Valandor Sef

Valandor Sef is a rakshasa who has displaced the soul of the real Valandor. He's also displaced the soul of the previous Guild Majors.
He sends Maximo a notice of his new payment as a Guild Major of the Brother's Company: 1000 gp / month, with promise of more once the Cycladene contracts begin. They will meet monthly until that point. He will receive further notice when a time is formally organized.

Valandor knows the importance of Maximo. He will keep an eye on him, ensuring that the Brother's Company continues to slowly escalate the religious war. He sees that the paladin is ambitious, and he may have a change of heart in how he deals with Maximo eventually. He could use his position of influence and trust to replace Adnan, mentoring Maximo into growing his power by pushing further into the religious war.

## Mahin

- The Orcus worship claims don't make sense--it's completely unaligned with everythign they hold precious about Shynedar
- Take advantage of the opening in the BC leadership. Plant a pro-Cycladene agent?
## Archdruid Liana

If Mysto goes to Liana, she says that the Grove has a much needed respite. They can regain their strength, but they are still very much in need of allies and strategies to push back.
She promotes Mysto, giving him an aditional use of wild shape. 3/day now
## Uzaxuk

Uzaxuk has taken the realm of Baphomet, though he cannot fully devour the realm until Baphomet is truly dead. Now he is vanished, disappeared somewhere. He wants an empire of the Abyss and the Material Plane, but he doesn't think too much about the details. Right now, there are several other powerful demons rising to fill the vacuums left by Tasha. He is battling them, but his eyes are on Orcus too. For now, he wants Carric to spread his name and his promise for power. He wants Carric to give him an Empire, an Army--whatever it takes.

Uzaxuk gives Carric rage power? Some way to spread Uzaxuk's influence?
Uzaxuk's Realm is injuncting into Carric's mind, allowing Uzaxuk to incluence, talk to, or even control him. The injunction can be spread via certain powers and rituals.

Carric can spread Uzaxuk's injunction with his hands. Normally, Abyssal injunctions are spread via the presence of a demon because a demon is synonymous with its realm. Even an existing injunction can spread itself. So... Carric can spread the injunction via spiritual actions that embody Uzaxuk's influence. Slaughter, terror, chaos, all in the name of Uzaxuk. Uzaxuk brings Carric into his Realm again and claims him as his champion, proven by his slaughter of Dariush Ishur. Uzaxuk boons Carric with demonic sigils burned into his palms, swirling across his fingers. Carric can 


## Yrah

Now that the sword is bound to the Lodge, Yrah simply hangs out in it unless it's travelling. If it is travelling, he moves with the Crew. His goal is to keep studying magic, seeking info about new or rare spells around the city. He will still be Rabbitouille's patron, but now that he is free he can also teach/help Rabbitouille with enchanting items and casting spells, making spell scrolls, etc.

## Rilan
Rilan is a cult master of Orcus working secretly along with Fraz. After two Rakshasas infiltrated the Duskivaines and seeded Orcus worship, he approached to organize them. He is working to summon Orcus to this plane so that the Crew can kill him. As a cultist of Orcus, he has communed several times with the Dark God and been very careful to cover his deceptions. He is thus a master of deception, able to fool even Orcus himself.
Rilan and the Crew: he controls Muck, and has made that known. He will use this to draw hatred of Orcus. How? He will make it imperative that they free Muck from Rilan.

Khas is Orcus's main servant. Rilan is his consort -- and a plant by Fraz. Rilan is a rakshasa vampire and one of Fraz's main servants within the upper echelons of the Empire.

## Veliu

Veliu manor is not huge. The family is prominent, but they are not insanely wealthy. They have a small collection of very old magic items, including a Lifewell mask, an item purchased from an archon long ago. It adheres to the face while attuned.
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:lifewell-tattoo
The mask is a Veliu heirloom, no longer worn but proudly displayed and even made a part of their heraldry.
The mask is on display in the Veliu grand entryway, protected by a simple alarm spell. The spell alerts the family's guards, 4 Helmed Horrors.
Other items of note:
Glamoured studded leather, bonus action to make the armor look like regular clothes, 13+DEX AC.
Both of these items are noted as major pieces of Veliu wealth in their accounting books, found in the study.
The armor is worn by the Veliu heir, Natasa Veliu. She works at the docks.

Notable Veliu's:
Head of household:
Lady Rania Veliu, married to Samir Veliu
Grown children: Dockmaster Natasa Veliu, handles Logistics of the New Tanore docks
Lawyer Kamil, operates between the Hauling Guild, the Bank, and the Theives Syndicates.
estranged Banker Yara Veliu.
Dumb, but muscled son, Jamil Veliu. He follows his sister Natasa around, protecting her.

After their mask was stolen, they called for an Inspector to be put on the case: Jeffers. Jeffers and several Incantators search the city briefly for the mask, about 1 day (6 hours), which costs ~4000 gp. They have disperse images of the mask through detect thoughts and then probe around the city with Locate Object. They first stay distant if they find their quarry, though they attempt to get a sketch and to meet the target discretely. This will help with scrying, which costs an additional 500 gp.
For every hour, roll 2d20 + 1d20 (from Nara). If a 20 is rolled while the Mask is out of the Lodge, the Incantators located their quarry and report back to the Velius with a description of the thief. With the thief's description (and ideally a drawing, or a meeting)
They'll scry and figure out the Thief's habits and where they live, if they can. Then, normally, a crack squad gets sent in to arrest the Thieves. Once Jeffers realizes who stole the mask, though, he is incredulous. He will approach the Crew first, asking if they came across it by accident--if so, they need to return it.

# Misc

Polymorphe shop, run by Nadim, who is doing research in developing a battle standard for the Brother's Company.
The Standard is a modified Battle Standard of Infernal Power, which relies on a caged imp. This battle standard, which will offer soldiers heroism + wrathful smite will have a caged white or black dragon wyrmling. Dragons are the original mortals of Asfalon--planar dragons are remnants of old Nousants, lost in the planescape. Essentially, they live everywhere. The closest populous of black and white dragons are the cold swamps of Bleakwood.



## What next

- What leads does the Crew have?
	- The Veliu's are somehow connected to the new potions.
	- A wizard is working with / leading the new potion makers.
What could they learn from the Veliu's? They help move the potions around, they are coordinated by an Iron Fist smuggler named Zara Bakalli. They get the potions handed off in Dragon's Rook after they come through the Wild Ring.
- Hint: check the Wildring!
- Hint: follow up on Zara Bakalli
Zara Bakalli hides out in the bottling warehouse. The bottling warehouse is guarded by Helmed Horrors and Cailana shows up if she hasn't confronted the Crew already halfway thorugh the combat along with several Fey'ri. It has barrels of potions to fall into, trees and vines, etc. The warehouse has evidence pointing towards Naz Bahar's influence: Geas; and also Cailana's influence: Fey'ri charming. Evidence towards Naz Bahar's Helmed Horror base outside New Tanore and of Cailana's residence at the Totem Keeper HQ.

- With the first confrontation finished and failed, Naz has a better idea of the Crew's strengths and weaknesses. Cailana also gets on their tail. If the next confrontation ends in the Crew being subdued, Cailana will offer to let the Crew live if DOrthyza can buy their company out: 10,000 gp if they cease all production forever.


Encounter with Cailana:
1 Cailana + 5 skin dancers

## Through the Wildring

The Wildring is an astral injunction bridging the Feywild Courts and the Prime Material plane. Just beyond it is a stretch of the Astral Plane called the Thither and the Wildroad, a gorgeous expanse of land that seems to stretch forever, the view of it almost warped like a fish-eye lens. Once one travels into it, though, your mind adjusts. The area around the Wildring is dominated by Fis/Fos effects, which balance because of its frequent use. Generally, when one appears in a new place they feel a sudden drop in temperature, the dissolution or decay of nearby plants, or the sudden deaths of animals. Thus, when passing through the Wildring, it's usually advised to buy a cheap animal to bring along with, which will usually die instead of you.
When someone has left the plane through the Wildring, the air around will experience a hotflash, plants will grow, storms start, etc.

The Wildroad is commonly traversed by travelers. The Fis/Fos effects make any attempts at housing or business around the Wildring impractical, but farther down the Wildroad there is the famous Safelight Inn, a refuge that many travelers find when they are afriad. It's run by a pair of archons, a Hound named Barney and a Lantern Archon named Alfariel. They take in people looking for safety, and generally the inn has several refugees in it. She serves food, though it is only for comfort as food offers no sustenance here.

The Astral lands around the Fey Courts take on their appearance--wild, natural, yet unruled and without bounds. It grows Elemental, fundamental, when near a piece of the Unravelling. There are sometimes vast swathes of nonexistance set in the wilds of the Astral. Currently, the Astral planes around the Feywild are shone down upon by several Wandering Stars. Most notably now is Caiphon, drawn to the border of Asfalon and the Astral. The Astral plane is timeless.

Astral plane is created from the threads of Arangil, the space of Artifex. It is thus only matter, timeless, formless, and traveling through it is a matter of will and thought. Navigation here is done with Insight rather than Survival.
Distance, time, etc are fluid here. Spells might last forever. Long casting times can be shortened. All people can make checks to let them bend the Astral space--letting them fall wherever they want. Essentially allows misty step but with damage if you're not careful.

A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas,
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this
powerful force.
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes,
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal
in a few rounds.
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers
journeying together suffers the same location effect.
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to
determine the location and mental effects.

## Shinfting Court of Arcturiadoom

To get through to Bleakwood, one only needs to pass through the edges of Arcturiadoom. Caiphon-influenced mutant Boggles try to mislead them though, drawing them closer in to Arcturiadoom by switchign road signs, felling trees, pickpotting, etc. They will offer to lead the party as guides, though they will simply guide them further into Arcturiadoom. A simple crossing takes 3 days -- every day, there's a chance that the Crew can meet hobgoblins, star spawn, hobgoblins, fire giants, etc. Each of these are mutated in some way by Arcturia. The land itself polymorphs according to her whims and unconcious wills.

Danger:
Clay that transfigures a person trapped in it. The boggles love this trap! They'll mold you into the opposite gender, or add funny features -- large nose, ears, etc.



## Fablerise

The Realm of the storyteller spider Yarnspinner.

Fablerise is a place of day and night; a beautiful and lovely exterior while Yarnspinner sleeps. His spiritual form awakens and reads stories to a circle of young animals. When Yarnspinner awakens, though, the facade drops and the horrible truth of Fablerise is shown. Fablerise is just that: a fable to cover the darkness of the reality of the Court of Yarnspinner. Yarnspinner awakens when breaks the rules of Fablerise.

Rules:
Obey the Narratives - engage in the Hero's Journey set before you!
This is described at the entrance of Fablerise, where the ghost of Yarnspinner is telling stories to little animals.
