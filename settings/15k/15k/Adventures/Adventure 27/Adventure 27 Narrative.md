-- Adventure 26 outcome : the Crew freed the Veliu's from their capture and forshadowed harassment by Cailana. They killed many of the guards and the archers, and the Veliu's (sans Kami, who was killed), escape into a safehouse and task the Crew with freeing the patriarch Samir.

#### Cailana
>[!note] Cailana
>Cailana is the willing servant of the beholder Dorthyza. He promised her freedom and protection from Solodovnika in exchange for her help in making his potion business easy and successful. She is a ruffian, a tomboy. She resents her slavery to Solodovnika, and will not return willingly.

#### Naz Bahar
>[!note] Naz
>Naz is a former Incantator who left in search of Leomund, who is in Dorthyza's prison. Naz found his mentor, but was dominated into Dorthyza's service and is being used to make Helmed Horrors and sway the populous.
>Because he is dominated, he is charmed. He believes himself a friend of Dorthyza -- who will take control of Naz if he is close to death and curse out the Crew.

#### Jeffers / Fraz
>[!quote] 
>"Good news! I have no idea where the stolen mask is. Wait. No -- that's the bad news. Good news! I believe I have a lead on Prismeer. I figured, well, who would know best where ol' Witch Tasha vanished off to? Well her ex-husband of course! It turns out that Zagyg's Tower passed through the Wildring last week, and word is that he was going after Tasha. Must be looking for those alimony payments! Anyway, as an upstanding Investigator of the Law, I am determined to trail him and find the lost school of Prismeer myself! However, uh, I am not necessarily the most fit to go galavanting through the Astral Plane, so I was looking to hire some mercenaries -- like you! Luckily, there's a huge amount of money coming in to the Inspector's office to find the school -- I guess rich parents don't like their children going missing, eh? I can offer each of you a handsome sum of 4,000 gold coins in addition to the truly immense admiration you would all receive from the people of the city!
 -- Fraz is casting himself as Jeffers so as to push the Prismeer investigation forward.

Where I want this to go: eventually, I want to draw them in to Tasha and reveal much about the plot (Fraz). This will let them choose their ending: kill the Cycladenes and take down Orcus, or help Orcus and take out Fraz. Or both!

- Introduce Cailana + her connection to Solodovnika. If they return her to Solodovnika, the Fey Queen will tell them anything they want to know, including where Prismeer went. OR... if they don't take the bait (or before they enter the Astral Plane in the first place), Jeffers tells them. Jeffers is actually Kalma. He is working for Fraz, but he doesn't want to be. He wants Fraz to fall, but he cannot speak against him or betray him -- it is the manner of his domination. 

Cailana first tries to curtail and control the Veliu's. She wants to make them pay for their betrayal. She will head towards the Veliu manor by way of the cliffs above the house, roping down onto rocky ledges from above.
will try to buy the business off the party for 20,000 gp. If they refuse, then she
