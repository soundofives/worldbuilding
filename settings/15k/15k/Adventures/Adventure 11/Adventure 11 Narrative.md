The Emperor tells Zagyg to go and find the Thief Blade, the Black Blade mentioned in the prophecy, and return it to the Last and First City for safe keeping. The Blade was used by Hehtan at the start of the Red Sun crisis. After he was cast down, the Blade was lost in the Traps. Eventually, when Sashism was at its peak during the Tanorian Empire the blade was recovered and wielded by Tanorian Queens for centuries. When the Tanorian Empire collapsed in the Dark Ages (around the start of time of the founding of Shada), the sword was lost to the monasteries in the Uruvand Traps. In his studies, Hykhe believes he found the last known location of the Blade and sent Zagyg to find it.

The Tanorian Empire was built on Sashism, vampirism, wizards, undeath, etc. This is what should be expected. Fire, lava, and death.

Zagyg is taking the Tower on the move, and Taforayesh has told all the members of the Tower to pack up and tie up loose business before setting out for several months.

Dragons raid the Tower during flight! The dragons are a new colony, a family that made their way from the Unravelling to the Prime Material. They are essentially predetors, not really considering the people as worthy of anything but being eaten.
2 part encounter:

Part 1: the young dragons. 1 whelp Blue Dragon, 5 whelp white dragons. (2,000 per player). Difficult environment x1.5 = 3,000 xp.
The young dragons smell out the weak and helpless, burrowing through walls to fight in enclosed spaces with holes in the wall. The Crew is sent to help save Ama + Zoran Wildgrain and Geranis the dryad groundskeeper.

Being outside is lightly obscured, difficult terrain with a chance at the start of your turn to get blown down (as gust of wind, STR 10 ). The groundskeeper hut is small, but enclosed. The dragons will blow a hole in the wall first turn and will add more, trying to topple the structure.

-enough time for a short rest.
Part 2: the older dragon. 1 Adult white dragon (2000 per player)
The older dragons come in to fight the troublemakers.
