Beginning of the Grand Revelry climatic mini-arc 

Way to tie up some loose ends with the Cycladene church, Orcus, the Brother's Company, etc before the Crew heads into the Astral Plane to find Dorthyza and Tasha.

A Chosen of the Bloodlord blessed with an Eye of Fire and Fear and wielding the Wand of Orcus attacks the Grand Church of the Myriad God in New Tanore / Grand Revelry fairgrounds. This strike sets off a schism within the Cycladene Church. Perhaps the Matriarch is killed by Kas, prompting the Shynedar Kai and Thesmata Kai to break away under the leadership of the Rook, who allies with Vecna and wields the Crook of Rao. The Raven Queen / Shynedar "manifests" and decrees this. Beric Dondarion style maybe? Someone comes back from the dead as the Rook.

Sanguine Cyclone in Revelry crowd, killing many, raising them as undead (via the Eye of Fire and Fear), inciting mass chaos.
