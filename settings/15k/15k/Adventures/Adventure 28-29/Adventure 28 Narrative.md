>[!tip] Adventure Summary
**With the Crew having dealt with the Green Magic potion dealers Cailana and Naz Bahar, their next steps seem to be seeking out the brain behind the operation: Dorthyza, who resides in the Isle of Dreams nestled deep in the Astral Plane. Before they go, there are loose ends to tie up around the Last and First City.**
>
Fraz has been causing mischief with Orcus's plots, revealing the presence of his cult within the Cycle of Twins. Orcus, increasingly desperate, sees the only way to keep his key agent Kasra safe as to have Kasra publicly cull the cultists. The Cycladenes want to use this opportunity to extend an olive branch to the Crew and to the Myriad, hoping for a faux peace that would allow Kasra to focus on his plot to kill the Emperor.
The Cycladene Orcus cult is going to attack the Grand Revelry, a festival of art, music, and dance to honor the Myriad goddess Thalindra. Kasra and a select force of Thesmata- and Shynedar-Kai are going to stop them.

### Yrah

>[!quote] Yrah and Rabbitouille
>*Yrah looks healthier now. He's dressed in the colorful eclectic robes of a young mage, an eager smile on his face*
>**Now that I've recovered my strengths, I think it's time that I teach you a spell that I couldn't before -- because it's not written anywhere. During my imprisonment, I learned to combine chronomancy and necromancy. I've already taught you some spells I've modified. I also created a new spell, the most difficult that I've ever cast. I listened to the Shadows, and through them I heard their deaths. Beyond that, I managed to uncover a connection to the death, such that it is possible to learn the spell that killed any creature. This is Yrah's Fantastic Forensics. I was able to simplify it as well, and now it is much easier to cast then when I first derived it. Let me show it to you:** Yrah's Fantastic Forensics, 5th lvl ritual spell, allows you to copy into your spellbook the spell that killed a corpse that you target with this spell. You must use the normal gold and time requirements for adding a spell to your spellbook in this way.

>**Using this technique, I learned some of the Emperor's own necromancy, the spells that he used on the shadows in the moments of their deaths: **

### The Brother's Company

>[!note] Goal 1: Shore up Adnan's old contacts in order to solidify Maximo's position within the Guild Council
>Adnan's popularity came from his parties and luxurious life. If Maximo wants those same contacts, he'll need to take over Adnan's role of party guy. One of Adnan's parties cost 3 gp x num guests. Adnan supported this extravagent cost by building up report -- people would bring gifts, Adnan was heavily invested, and had a large wealth from private deals, etc. He had around 30 mercenaries, 30 +1s, 30 whores, 15 staff, ~100 people.
>
>- mention the Grand Revelry coming up. Perhaps Maximo can "sponsor" a party at the Revelry?
>
>If Maximo hosts these parties, he can generally completely replace Adnan as the populist member of the Guild Council.

>[!note] The Trial
>
>Maximo must stand trial before a convening of the Brother's Company's primary stakeholders, aristocratic investors from around the city, testifying against any crimes committed in relation to Adnan's death. The trial is not criminal, but instead it is to decide more permanently whether Maximo is to have decision making power on the Brother's Company Guild Council. Many of Adnan's parties involved these stakeholders.
>
>Without any kind of interference, Maximo will be walking into a Kangaroo Court controlled by Valandor Sef, whose force of personality hedges the stakeholders against Maximo. Valandor doesn't want to see Maximo ousted, but he doesn't want the boy interfering with his control of the Company.
>
>>[!hint] The Tip
>>Maximo is tipped off to the corrupt trial by a Cycladene agent, the middle-aged Vikmir Duskivaine, grandchild of Dragana, who wants to gain his trust and sway him so that the Brother's Company gives the Cycaldenes more favorable treatment in the future.
>>>[!quote] Vukmir Duskivaine
>>>*You have a lot of potential, Maximo Octavio de Costa. Potential to sway the path of this City for the better and weigh down your pockets while you're at it. I am Vukmir Duskivaine, a brother within the Shynedar-Kai. I know our groups have bled each other in the past -- but the winds are changing. We see a way in which we could aid each other, and you could find Shynedar's forgiveness. For now, we have three gifts for you. The first: a warning. The trial you approach is by no means fair. Valandor Sef has the shareholders in his pocket after the death of Adnan. While they won't arrest you, walking blindly into this trial will ensure that you never have a say on the Guild Council as long as Valandor Sef lives. Our second gift: the Guild Major Gadovan Rahimi -- he is not who he appears to be. He is a fey come from Bleakwood, and a worshiper of the Elder Evils. A blasphemer who seeks to bring the City under the influence of his evil masters. Our third gift will become obvious to you soon. For now, I must leave.*
>
>The Trial is scheduled for the middle of the Grand Revelry, at a small extension of the Brother's Company guild hall in Dragon's Rook.
>The stakeholders, Valandor, Elara, and Gadovan are in the trial, guests are allowed in to watch. Karthain doesn't show -- it is revealed after the trial that he has been assassinated.
>
>The trial is straightforward. A cleric of Heironeous casts Zone of Truth and forces Maximo to fail his save. Trial has questions like, "Recount for us the night that Adnan died." and derivative questions.
>2. "State for us that you were not involved in any way in the death of Adnan Alisi."
>
>If Maximo admits to the murder, Valandor will be surprised, and the convention will be shocked. The conveners loved Adnan (they loved his parties at least), and while this would impress Valandor, it turns them off. The questioning then turns -- "Why would you do this?" This is Maximo's opportunity to persuade them, but it's a difficult check ! DC 20.

### Borlaw
Catching up after the Green Magic arc. At this point, level 10, Borlaw can't refute the Crew's growing influence and power. At this point, with the possibility of a large merger between Dorthyza and the Crew, Borlaw wants to clinch his alliance by revealing his trust. With the increasing chaos through the City, Especially with the increasing chaos brewing in the City, Borlaw wants to lay the reasons for his expectations bare. He can't seem desperate -- but he can begin to treat Carric as a partner. Then, if Carric continues to sew chaos, it can be treated as willing disobedience.


>[!quote] Borlaw
>
>What to reveal: the Bank invests in weapons and has deals with the mercenary companies. They profit from the escalation and prolonging of the war. Their tool: Control. When you have control of a situation, there is no risk.
>
>Scene: Borlaw in relaxing linen tunic, painting an oceanscape during Revelry. Tells Carric that the Bank profits significantly off of the war and the mercenary groups. The man Valandor Sef who runs the Brother's Company is an ally of sorts, though he has alternative motives. In any case, the war's escalation must be balanced -- victory means loss of profits. Through the Bank's investment in the military-industrial complex, any spread and use of weapons and mercenaries is good, but push it too far and cause too much chaos and you threaten to disenfranchise the bureaucracy, alienate the people of the Empire, and collapse the economy (can't have an economy without people). The key is Balance and discretion -- and this is why the Bank rose out of Cycladene ideologies in the first place. The Bank is solidly lawful neutral - they don't tolerate chaos well.
>
>Borlaw doesn't know the exact nature of Carric and Uzaxuk's connection, but he sees that chaos follows the Crew wherever they go. He puts this forward: he would love to see the connection between the Bank and the Crew's potions grow. They would continue to help support the business and would enjoy a cut of the merger's profits. BUT -- the Bank needs the Crew to learn control:
>*"Learn to control the power that you have, and your future with the Bank will be profitable. Continue spreading chaos and threatening to undermine everything that my bosses have built over centuries and we will be forced to take actions that I don't want to take. I like you kid -- but whatever you've gotten mixed up in will only get you killed in the end."*

### Koshi's Ritual
Ritual before the grand revelry to give Koshi his Penitent's Blood Boon.

Koshi takes part in a ritual of Arinas as he sets out on his chosen Penitent Mission which he must state during the ritual. The Heiromerus, Virgin Archpriestess, of the facet of Arinas caries out a ritual of libation over Koshi as he officially begins his Penitent Quest.

>[!success] Boon
>**Penitent's Blood, recharges on long rest**
>Your sacrifice brings the blessing of Arinas to those around you. Once per day as a reaction to being reduced below half your total hit points, you can bless the weapons of each friendly creature within 30 feet. Weapon attacks made by those creatures for the next minute do an additional 2d8 radiant damage on a hit.

### Mahin
Mahin Orzai is sister to Kasra Orzai. She's likely an Orcus worshipper - and a high-up one at that. Her grandmother, Dragana, was very defensive of her -- Dragana is probably Orcus as well. The Eye of Fear and Flame is Danoris (13), child of Malin Duskivaine (Thesmata Kai general). Mahin is the Chosen of Orcus, who wants to recruit Rabbitouille -- but she doesn't tell him about her part in the upcoming attack.

Does she know she's set up by Kasra? I think partially. She has been promised undeath by Orcus - as long as her body can be recovered, she will be raised as a lich or demilich. Same for Danoris, the kid.

>[!quote] Mahin Orzai
>Mahin knows that Rabbitouille is a necromancer. She wants to come clean with him about that -- she "spoke with her family (Shynedar Kai, Fayesh) about the Touilles and heard about Rabbi's necromancy."
>
>*"You know, my cousin's son -- Fayesh -- said that he spoke to you (after the Ball). He said that you would make a good ally, even though you're a necromancer.*
>
>*Much of my family would balk that I'm even here talking with you. Cavorting with necromancy isn't really what we're known for. In fact, fighting against wanton necromancy is a core tenant of Shynedar's worship -- the dead should stay dead. But, there are some in my family that have come to see differently, and I think they would find a way to accept you into our Church. I mean, look around us! The City is filled with undeath - vampires, bureaucrats, guards. We look passed them but not necromancy for its own sake?*
>
>If she's pushed:
>*"Some in my family have even started studying necromancy, even though I think that's the root of our feud with the Ishurs and the Bank. They much more readily use necromancy--but only state sanctioned necromancy, I'm sure. My cousin, Isidra, got pretty good at it before... well, she studied at the Obsidian Citadel. She was actually next in line to succeed my Grandmother and Great Aunt as one of the Matriarchs. I'm not eligible, as an Orzai. The Matriarch needs to be entirely matrilineal, and I'm only related to the Duskivaines through my father."*
>

Mahin has overheard that an attack was going to happen during the Myriad's Grand Revelry, and that her brother Kasra Orzai -- Archlord of Defense -- was mobilizing the Thesmata-Kai and Shynedar-Kai to stop them. Mahin begs Rabbitouille to come with her and see that her people aren't -- can't -- be Orcus worshipers. It goes against everything that Shynedar stands for.

### Rilan
>[!quote] Rilan
>*Rilan finds the Crew. He is a plant by Fraz whose main goal is to keep tabs on Kasra and control Muck (and thus he was responsible for putting the Crew together). He wants to keep the Crew oriented against Orcus, and so he'll bring them in on the Grand Revelry attack*
>
>*He has intel that an attack is going to happen during the Grand Revelry from a splinter group within the Cycladene Church. Kasra Orzai has mobilized the Thesmata-Kai and Shynedar-Kai to help protect the Myriad's festival, but Rilan goes to the Crew as the most famous mercenaries in the Last and First City. Kasra seeks the Crew as powerful mercenaries capable of helping defeat the upcoming attack. He wants the Crew as backup and extra arms to identify the attacker and take them out.*
>
>Rilan offers the Crew 1000 gold each -- and the removal of their Death Marks.
>

#### Kasra

Kasra is a swordfighter -- and the Archlord of Defense for the Empire. His part in this is to move in and stop the assault of the Chosen of Orcus. He has a good amount of Thesmata and Shynedar-Kai at his disposal, but his consort Rilan convinced him to hire the Crew to supplement their forces.

## The Grand Revelry

>[!abstract] The Revelry Grounds
>The Grand Revelry is a festival of music, dance, art, color, and creativity, held in and around the Bards College and the Thalindra Theatre in Bonz. The College sits along the edge of the Ravine, and a magical fountain outside the Theatre creates a shallow pond and waterfall.
>The Theatre is a huge ring with a stage building on one side (model after the Globe). In front of it, a garden colonnade points towards a small artisans quarter, where streamers and artists paint the streets and other people! Tapestries, carpets, and banners are hung from windows, and paper flowers are woven into hanging vines.
>Things to see:
>Face painting
>Interpretive Dance
>Parade of minstrels
>musicians on every corner
>magical fire juggler - colorful!
>FOOD! The dwarven beer brewers have a few kegs here as part of a brewing competition. They have been hard hit by Uzaxuk's Symbol (causes Insanity and Discord), but this festival is a time to spread their ale.
>
>Notable Duskivaines and others in attendance:
>- Talmir
>- Vukmir
>- Fayesh
>- Malin (Thesmata)
>- Testra
>  
>Others in attendance:
>- Inspector Jeffers
>- Yrah
>- Phillip
>- the Veliu's
>- Borlaw
>- Layla the alchemist
>- Torvir and Ellyn, dwarvish toy merchants
>- Arik Kala - the stuttery banker
>- The fencer that Maximo beat outside the Shark (Hadi Zeq, Tiefling)
>- Druids - after the assassination of the Logging Guild Master 4 months ago, the Children of Erthynul have regrown and the Grove of Obad-Hai has been able to regroup. The Children of Erythnul have been bolstered by outlander tribes -- those from distant southern hills and dark forests. One of these outlanders, Didjumata, brought with her knowledge of the spirit of the Coal-Eyed Boar God, Marvoch the Beast, who could be returned to rampage through Sinisa. Marvoch was one of the great spirits of the Druids before they were forcibly resettled by the Empire. When the Cycladene Archpriest cursed the Children of Erythnul, he did so by separating them from their God Spirits, whom he forced out into the Astral Sea and drove them mad with the corruption of Shynedar. If Marvoch can be found and cleansed, he could return to the Druids and rampage through the city.

## Interlude - Solodovnika

>[!quote] Solodovnika, through the Staff of the Woodlands
>*"I have sensed Cailana's breath within the nostrils of your ally. You have found her. Bring her to my roost in the Bleakwood, and I shall reward you well: bring me my consort and I will grant you a single wish."*

---

>[!warning] Finding the Chosen
>
>This time: the Crew has successfully locked down many cultists on the outside with a great nat 20 and good organization of their forces. Now, Mahin is growing desperate for a show of her powers. She knows that she needs to strike and that the Cycladenes need to be seen battling her. She will tell Rabbitouille that she needs to find her cousing NOW -- because he is the one that they're all looking for.
>
>>[!quote] Mahin
>>*"Rabbitouille, we need to find my cousin NOW...because he's the one you're all looking for."*
>>She looks pained, desperate, guilty. She refuses to explain how she knows all this at the moment, saying *"Please, I'll explain it all later, but time is running out!"*
>>>
>
Brief question on how they search, which sets up a skill challenge to chase him and catch him. During the search, if Mahin is free to talk to Rabbitouille, she will switch the tone of her conversation:
>>[!quote] Mahin
>>*"Rabbitouille, please forgive me. I haven't been telling the truth, but I swear I'm going to come clean. I'm begging you to listen to me -- what lengths would you go to save your people? Your family?"*
>>

Some relevant skills: Perception, Investigation, Insight, Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, spells + attacks.
Danoris is going to be a child on stage, waiting to slink upstairs to the rafters when he is signalled - but the search prompts him to go early if he's discovered.
Chase challenges, DC 16 if double chase, 18 if single chase.
Danoris kills and instantly raises an innocent bystander in his way, turning them into a zombie. The Zombie attempts to grapple one of the Crew DC 16 Dex save or Athletics/Acrobatics check.
Danoris blows up the stairs with a flaming burst of magic, toppling them.

>Danoris clicks his winged boots and flies ahead -- he stays within the structure to give him cover though.
>A darkness spell gets thrown down - (InSight/Arcana 20, Danoris didn't cast it)

>
Base Clot: 1. For each failure the Crew gets, an additional Clot is summoned (up to 4!!)

>Just before Mahin splits, she holds out her hand to Rabbitouille:
>>[!quote] Mahin
>>Just after she uses Graveway Travel to get an initial escape:
>>Beckoning to Rabbitouille: *"Please? I can give you His gifts!"*
>
>Mahin will try to split off once Danoris is revealed and head towards her hidden staff and grimoire. She can use Graveway travel to get out of a grapple or Hold once. Set up a double chase maybe? Some going after Mahin, some going after Danoris? Letting Mahin get to the top = she finds the staff and grimoire, buffing her. Letting Danoris get to the top = more Clots!
>
>Mahin immediatly downs 2 innocents and releases Horde Ghouls from Thanatos, using them to boost her/ throw her/ block attacks, etc. She will kill more and raise more Ghouls, using them to trip, shove, block the PCs chasing her. She'll also open small rifts to Thanatos to try to trip PCs up.

The Grimoire:

>[!warning] The Attack
>
>
>
**A group of Cultists led by a Chosen of the Bloodlord and a perched child with Winged Boots bearing the Eye of Fire and Fear attack the Grand Revelry fairgrounds.**
The Child climbs into the rafters of the Theatre to get a vantage point, and the Chosen, disguised as a tragic villain in the play, emerges on stage, in the background. He begins his magical ritual, trying to cast Sanguine Cyclone (ability starts un-charged, needs to roll 5 or 6 to charge). The Chosen can be spotted, and the Crew could have a chance to delay the Cyclone. If combat starts, the Chosen will still cast the spell immediately.
The Chosen creates a Sanguine Cyclone in the center of the theatre, quickly spreading and slaughtering festival-goers who are raised by the Eye of Flame and Fear and formed into Zombie Clots. Once the Clots are created, the Child flies onto one of their backs as it rampages and generally uses its winged boots to evade the Crew. The Chosen slips out into the crowd. The crowds panic, running randomly to get away from the disaster. The cultists attack the streets outside the Theatre from nearby alleys and tents, making primarily for Myriad clerics.
Thesmata-Kai oathsworn move in, protecting innocents. Shynedar kai move in and start attacking zombies, ghouls, cultists in the crowd. Myriad clerics (Penitents of Arinas, Knights of Heironeous), city guards, and the Emperor's shadows descend on the chaotic scene. Pillars of sacred flame burn Orcus's undead, guards battle against cultists, and Thesmata-Kai oathsworn shield the innocent. Shadows swirl overhead in a storm of darkness.
>-----------------------------------------------------------------
>Now: many cultists have been locked down. People will be much safer outside the main combat area, and they can even be saved within it if the Crew acts well. The Thesmata Kai will team up with Myriad clerics to surround the Theatre with a protective wall of divine energy, giving the following benefits:
>The area within the divine shield is considered roughly Hallowed by Thesmata and Arinas:
Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by an evil creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.
When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.
>**Energy Vulnerability.** Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to fire
>**Courage.** Advantage against being Frightened.
>
>**Terrain:** The Sanguine Cyclone rages in the heart of the Theatre until the Chosen loses concentration on it. It expands, ripping people apart and creating a damaging zone. Around the Cyclone and throughout the streets, panicking crowds are inter spaced with battling clerics, knights, zombies, etc. In a crowd / battle, you have to make an Athletics check (DC 12) or be moved 15 ft in a random direction. Have a 50% chance of taking 10 damage from enemies or getting healed 10 points from paladins or clerics.
>

Also uses the Plague Breath spell which he has in his grimoire.

>[!success] Rewards, XP, Renown
>**Possible renown:** Myriad+5, Cycladenes+5
>**Loot:** Cycladenes will pay the Crew 1000 gp per person and forgive the Death Mark. Myriad officials will offer less - 100 gold per person for the info and for help if the Crew goes to them.
>- Winged Boots (worn by Danoris)
>- Dark Grimoire +1 (held by Mahin Orzai)
>**XP:**
>1 Chosen of the Bloodlord (CR 12)
>1 Eye of Fear and Flame (CR 9)
>2 Zombie Clots (CR 6)
> - 9000 XP per player
>XP after Adventure 27: 82,000. Next level at 85,000.
>XP after Adventure 28: 91,000. LEVEL 11! Level 12 at 100,000.

#### After effects of the attack
This strike sets off a schism within the Cycladene Church. Perhaps the Matriarch is killed by Kas, prompting the Shynedar Kai and Thesmata Kai to break away under the leadership of the Rook. Shynedar may "manifest" and decrees this.

### The Inspector
Inspector Jeffers approaches them at the end of the Grand Revelry

>[!quote] 
>"Good news! I have no idea where the stolen Veliu mask is. Wait. No -- that's the bad news. Good news! I believe I have a lead on Prismeer. I figured, well, who would know best where ol' Witch Tasha vanished off to? Well her ex-husband of course! It turns out that Zagyg's Tower passed through the Wildring last week, and word is that he was going after Tasha. Must be looking for those alimony payments! Anyway, as an upstanding Investigator of the Law, I am determined to trail him and find the lost school of Prismeer myself! However, uh, I am not necessarily the most fit to go galavanting through the Astral Plane, so I was looking to hire some mercenaries -- like you! Luckily, there's a huge amount of money coming in to the Inspector's office to find the school -- I guess rich parents don't like their children going missing, eh? I can offer each of you a handsome sum of 4,000 gold coins in addition to the truly immense admiration you would all receive from the people of the city!
 -- Fraz is casting himself as Jeffers so as to push the Prismeer investigation forward.

# Through the Wildring:

Quests:
Find Marvoch the Beast
Force Cailana back to Solodovnika (if you don't she'll reward you as a powerful Fey ally)
Follow Zagyg and find Prismeer
Meet with Dorthyza


Other things I thought of:

Re-introduce Adnan Alisi as an imp for Maximo.
Adnan was also in service to Levistus -- though he was passed up by his apprentice. Levistus had given Adnan unnatural charisma and boons for his service, in exchange for his eternal servitude. Now he is a phlegmatic imp with the most cowardly parts of his personality amplified.

### The Wand of Orcus
![[Pasted image 20240817192702.png]]
For Rabbitouille:
While you are attuned to the Wand of Orcus, your body rots over the course of four days. You lose your hair by the end of day 1, paw tips and toes by day 2. Your lips and nose decay by day 3. You lose most of your weight by the end of day 4 becoming an almost skeletal figure, which reduces your Strength and Constitution each by 2. These negative effects can be reversed with a **regenerate** spell, though they immediately begin again.

Also, attuning to the Wand of Orcus demands your loyalty to the Bloodlord.

### Meeting with Cailana

The New Tanore druid Circle, the **Hefsansarak**, or the Totem Keepers, are an egalitarian group that interfaces with the Bureaucracy to govern the city. They ensure natural influence on all things, though allow the Urban concepts of commerce, people, etc, to exist in harmony with their protective rites. They are very protective and traditional, ritualistic and safeguarded. They take pilgrims of the Land, and their HQ is in a totemic grove in the center of the city, split over the chasm. Tree-branch bridges connect the two sides. Pilgrims who come to them have annonymety, unless they say otherwise. Entrance into the grove is strictly forbidden for those carrying iron-based metals.
	Archdruid of the Hefsansarak: **Heiydark**, an ancient druid. His spokesman is **Nidal**. 


## Through the Wildring

**New understanding: The Wildring is a boundary between Arangil and Asfalon; Arangil is an extension of Asfalon and thus they are technically the same plane.**
Travelling between them is thus easier, and travelling between the Astral plane and other planes is flavored like the "Deep Ethereal", deep misty walls.

The Wildring is an astral injunction bridging the Feywild Courts and the Prime Material plane. Just beyond it is a stretch of the Astral Plane called the Thither and the Wildroad, a gorgeous expanse of land that seems to stretch forever, the view of it almost warped like a fish-eye lens. Once one travels into it, though, your mind adjusts. The area around the Wildring is dominated by Fis/Fos effects, which balance because of its frequent use. Generally, when one appears in a new place they feel a sudden drop in temperature, the dissolution or decay of nearby plants, or the sudden deaths of animals. Thus, when passing through the Wildring, it's usually advised to buy a cheap animal to bring along with, which will usually die instead of you.
When someone has left the plane through the Wildring, the air around will experience a hotflash, plants will grow, storms start, etc.

The Wildroad is commonly traversed by travelers. The Fis/Fos effects make any attempts at housing or business around the Wildring impractical, but farther down the Wildroad there is the famous Safelight Inn, a refuge that many travelers find when they are afriad. It's run by a pair of archons, a Hound named Barney and a Lantern Archon named Alfariel. They take in people looking for safety, and generally the inn has several refugees in it. She serves food, though it is only for comfort as food offers no sustenance here.

The Astral lands around the Fey Courts take on their appearance--wild, natural, yet unruled and without bounds. It grows Elemental, fundamental, when near a piece of the Unravelling. There are sometimes vast swathes of nonexistance set in the wilds of the Astral. Currently, the Astral planes around the Feywild are shone down upon by several Wandering Stars. Most notably now is Caiphon, drawn to the border of Asfalon and the Astral. The Astral plane is timeless.

Astral plane is created from the threads of Arangil, the space of Artifex. It is thus only matter, timeless, formless, and traveling through it is a matter of will and thought. Navigation here is done with Insight rather than Survival.
Distance, time, etc are fluid here. Spells might last forever. Long casting times can be shortened. All people can make checks to let them bend the Astral space--letting them fall wherever they want. Essentially allows misty step but with damage if you're not careful. 

Terrains:
Prime Material
Feywild
Elemental Plane Water
Plane Fire
Earth
Air

A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas,
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this
powerful force.
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes,
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal
in a few rounds.
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers
journeying together suffers the same location effect.
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to
determine the location and mental effects.

## Shinfting Court of Arcturiadoom

To get through to Bleakwood, one only needs to pass through the edges of Arcturiadoom. Caiphon-influenced mutant Boggles try to mislead them though, drawing them closer in to Arcturiadoom by switchign road signs, felling trees, pickpotting, etc. They will offer to lead the party as guides, though they will simply guide them further into Arcturiadoom. A simple crossing takes 3 days -- every day, there's a chance that the Crew can meet hobgoblins, star spawn, hobgoblins, fire giants, etc. Each of these are mutated in some way by Arcturia. The land itself polymorphs according to her whims and unconcious wills.

Danger:
Clay that transfigures a person trapped in it. The boggles love this trap! They'll mold you into the opposite gender, or add funny features -- large nose, ears, etc.
