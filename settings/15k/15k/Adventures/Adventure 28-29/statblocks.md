Mahin will use her first turn to kill some bystanders and raise them as horde ghouls to protect her. She'll only really get a full host of horde ghouls once she's bloodied (Open the Corpsevaults). She raises any that die with her Eternal tide at the beginning of her turns. She also uses these ghouls for her Reclaim Anima. She'll use her legendary actions primarily to direct her Clots (with Impel the Horde) and to draw the Crew into the Sanguine Cyclone, focusing on people that are Feared by Danoris.
She'll use her Drown in Blood at every opportunity, and her Wand of Orcus whenever she makes a melee attack (if it is charged)

Once below 50 HP, Danoris goes to stand next to Mahin to take them both to Thanatos with his Deadfire Escape.

DONT FORGET UNDEAD MASS! Or, likely, just give it 10 dmg.
The Clot uses its Crush of Bodies on bystanders if nothing is climbing on it. If it gets hit with a melee attack, it will always use its reaction to grapple that creature than use Engulf on its turn.
If it is getting low on HP, it will gobble up bystanders and gain 4d12 temp HP at the start of its next turn.
It uses Shakes of Flesh at any ranged threats.

Horde Ghouls will attack anything they can reach, but they won't leave from around Mahin if they can help it. Otherwise, if she has 3 or more aroun dher, they will all attempt to grapple the target and drag it infront of Mahin, where she will kill it with the Wand of Orcus.
