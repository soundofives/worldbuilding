**The Fire Watch**
An organized fire watch, recently implemented as a collaboration between the Bureaucracy and the Incantator's Guild.

The Fire Watch responds to fires throughout the Last and First City and has stations in many districts. Dispatches consist of a group of undead guards who serve to transport water, sand, or other firefighting materials via a cart or boat to the scene of the fire. Several trained Incantators also join the dispatch, working in groups of three to cast scrolls of Control Water to help stop the fire. If a fire is especially large, multiple dispatch groups can be sent out, including more powerful or high ranking Incantators.
In Touchstone, fires are generally responded to very quickly due to not having to transport water.
