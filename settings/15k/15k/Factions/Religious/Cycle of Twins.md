The Cycle of Twins is an ancient and dualistic religion deeply ingrained in the history and culture of the empire. It revolves around the worship of two gods, Thesmata and Shynedar, who represent contrasting concepts. The religion's adherents, known as Cycladenes, adhere to the belief that everything in the world is intrinsically connected to the balance of these dualities. Here's an overview of the Cycle of Twins:

**Core Beliefs**:

1. **Thesmata and Shynedar**: Thesmata is the god associated with positive and desirable aspects of life, such as light, wisdom, prosperity, and benevolence. Shynedar, in contrast, represents negative elements like darkness, chaos, misfortune, and malevolence.
    
2. **Duality**: The central tenet of the Cycle of Twins is the interplay of dualities. Cycladenes believe that everything in the world is a manifestation of this balance, and both Thesmata and Shynedar are essential for the world's equilibrium.
    
3. **Worship in Pairs**: Cycladenes practice their faith by paying tribute to both gods, often in pairs. They believe that harmonizing both deities in their rituals ensures that life remains in balance.
    

**History and Influence**:

1. **Once-Powerful Institution**: The Cycle of Twins was once the most influential religious institution in the empire. It played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Bank of Miros and provided substantial subsidies to magical universities, promoting the empire's prosperity.
    
2. **Weakening Authority**: Over time, the Bank of Miros and the magical universities have matured and grown increasingly independent. As a result, the Cycle of Twins has lost much of its political and economic influence.
    

**Current State**:

1. **Religious War with The Myriad**: The Cycle of Twins is currently embroiled in a religious war with a rival faith known as The Myriad. The conflict is characterized by fervent theological debates and sometimes even violence between the two religious groups.
    
2. **Weakened Influence**: The Cycle of Twins has witnessed a decline in its adherents and authority. Many have turned to The Myriad for spiritual guidance, drawn by its more progressive and open philosophy.
    
3. **Internal Divisions**: Within the Cycle of Twins, there is a divide between traditionalists who wish to maintain their beliefs and practices and reformists who are open to revising certain aspects to appeal to a broader audience.

The Cycle of Twins is an old institution with extensive headquarters in the huge Temple of the Twins in Sinisa. The church is run--almost exclusively--by the Duskivaine family. The Duskivaines are a wide family of dark elves often intermarried with members of the vampire clans of Ithalas and the Ishur family that runs the Bank of Miros. The matriarch of the family is Dragana Duskivaine, the Fifth Life of Ivara. She's flanked by her sisters, Saira, Maja, and Bojia. Them and their families make up some of the highest ranks in the Cycle.

The Duskivaine estates are spread across the seven Pales. Dragana lives primarily within the great Temple of the Twins as the high priestess, but she owns and often resides in the ancestral family castle in the hills outside Sinisa.
