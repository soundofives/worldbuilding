The Bank of Miros is an immensely powerful and influential financial institution in the Empire, with its reach extending far beyond banking and finance. Its role in shaping the Empire's economy and politics is unparalleled, and its secretive operations make it an enigmatic and formidable presence.

## History
The final conquests of Oz'Leshah and the Second Tanorian Empire alongside the construction of Touchstone brought on the ***middle crisis*** of the Empire in the 150th century. From the instability rose the golden age of the Church of the Cycladenes, the [[Cycle of Twins]]. The Church was controlled by the ***[[House of Duskivaine]]***, in which the young [[Kasra Duskivaine | Kasra, Fifth on the Spire of Miros, Duskivaine]] grew up.
*Kasra established the financial power of the Duskivaines in the 148th century.*
Kasra married into the ***[[House of Ishur]]***, and thus the Bank of Miros passed to them and a tight alliance was tied between the House of Ishur and the House of Duskivaine.

As the Bank matured into the 146th century, the power of the Cycladenes was beginning to wane. The Bank stepped in, replacing the Cycladenes as the most powerful organization by the 144th century, under the new administration of Kasra's daughter, ***[[Ljiljana Ishur]]***. Ljiljana pushed the Bank beyond its role as a financial institution: it became entwined into the fabric of the Last and First City and its government. Ljiljana realized the profitability in the mercenary industry, and she grew a quiet alliance between the large mercenary groups and the Bank. In an underhanded move in the 143rd century, the Bank of Miros began to use secretive operations and manipulations to orchestrate a ***war*** between the ***[[Church of the Myriad]]*** and the Cycladenes.

About two centuries ago, Ljiljana passed on her leadership to her eldest daughter, ***[[Soza Ishur]]***. Ljiljana still lives, acting as a powerful figurehead and dowager of the House of Ishur.

## Activities

The main business of the Bank of Miros is to offer various financial services and loans to factions and individuals. The Bank also plays a large role in investing in Guilds and industries, most importantly the perfume and spice industries and the hauling and logistics syndicates. These groups are tightly entwined with the interests of the Bank. More secretly, the Bank of Miros also has significant interest in the mercenary guilds and their activities, through which they make money from their war. Essentially, the Bank of Miros pits the two churches against each other. The churches hire mercenaries, and the mercenaries give the Bank a cut of the profits. Adnan is in on this--it's why he's so wealthy. However, the Bank of Miros still wants to control the Mercenaries--they are the military, after all, so crippling them with addicting potions is perfect.

The Bank maintains and grows its position by leveraging its extensive connections throughout the Last and First City, from the Bureaucracy to many of the Guilds, Churches, and Mercenary groups. Beyond dealing in money, the Bank of Miros deals in *politics*, of course with a careful and secretive hand.

**Dealings with the Bureaucracy**
The Bank uses its Bureaucratic connections to push its influence over financial law and any government policies that would affects its wide array of interests.

**Dealings with Guilds**
The Bank exercises control over various guilds and industries, providing them with capital and support while significantly influencing their direction and decisions.

**Dealings with the Churches**
The Bank's association with the Cycle of Twins and the Church of the Myriad are much more secretive. Publically, the Bank of Miros is aligned with the Cycle of Twins through the tight alliance between the House of Ishur and the House of Duskivaine. The Bank uses this connection to threaten excommunication from the powerful Cycladenes should large loans not be repaid. In reality, the Bank of Miros deals with both religious factions, acting as both a double agent between them and a force against them. The Bank is the conductor of the ongoing conflict between the Churches, revolving around the Myriad's motion to engulf the deities of the Cycle of Twins into their all-encompassing God. Both Churches increasingly rely on mercenaries to carry out their fights for them, taking out loans from the Bank of Miros to fund their contracts. The Bank profits from a sly deal with the mercenary groups while also profiting from interest on the loans to the Churches. The Bank uses its political influence and espionage network to escalate the war.

**Dealings with the Banking Guild**
The Bank of Miros is in constant conflict and competition with the smaller banks organized into the [[Banking Guild]]. The Bank of Miros actively attempts to undermine them at every turn.

**Dealings with Spice Cartels**
Association with cartels

The Bank of Miros tends to have many hidden agendas. When it might publicly appear neutral, it actively seeks to manipulate events in its favor through whatever means necessary. The Bank's spies have incriminating information and evidence against several powerful individuals in the City.

Worth/assets: 18 million gp.
Approx. 0.0016 the worth of the LFC (gdp around 11 billion gp). The Medici bank was about 0.0002 of the GDP of Italy.
Approx 0.000008 the worth of the entire Empire (gdp around 2.2 trillion gp)
On average, the bank has a net income of around 180,000 gp / year, but this fluctuates quite a bit. This 18 million gp net worth has been accrued over hundreds of years and withstood significant turmoil. About a 1% growth rate over its ~700 yr history could set this up. Initial investment of 10,000 gp.
If there are 1500 mercenaries working for avg of 45 gp / month and the Bank gets 10%, then the Bank is earning about 6,700 gp / month from the war. Thats 80,000 per year. This is a profit increase for the bank of 44%. It is, indeed, worth it.
