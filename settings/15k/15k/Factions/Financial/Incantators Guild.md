Current status:
The Incantators are in a bind. The Obsidian Citadel and Prismeer have both crumbled or vanished, leaving only the Tower left to educate new mages. Essentially, the Incantators--and the City in general--are facing a magical demographic bottleneck. Newfound sorcerers will have nowhere to hone their skills--except the Tower, which can't take in a hundred students. The Tower's prices increase, and it leaves many bitter young sorcerers in the streets, as it can't teach them. Over the last month, Incantators are approached to work as private tutors, which many do. Soon, a young Incantators School will open and take its place as a new magical university. It will rise and last until the end of the Last and First City.
