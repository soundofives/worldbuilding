of Hextor and Heironeous

Headed by Murlynd, a former member of the Company of Seven and a friend of Zagyg.

Founded under the names of the deity brothers Hextor and Heironeous, the Brothers' Company is a prominent mercenary group in the Last and First City. While the company's primary motivations are pragmatic and secular, they maintain a veneer of respect for the values associated with the Brothers. In the myth of the Myriad, the Brothers are arch enemies, constantly fighting to best each other. The Company pushes ideals of competition and strength, fostering an environment where members compete and challenge each other, believing that competition breeds strength. However, they also understand that unity is essential for success, and every member stands together during contracts. They hold justice, and honor through that justice, in high regard. In the eyes of the Brotherhood, justice is given through the mercenary contract, and justice should never be given freely.

The Brother's Company, like all adventurer mercenary groups, arose in tandem with magic.
700 years ago, when the Empire emerged from the Middle Crisis, magical scholarship expanded. The early wizards hired adventuring groups to protect them, fetch their ingredients, or hunt for lost artifacts. By 500-400 years ago, the society of the Last and First City gave rise to guilds which organized the chaotic economy that characterized the City after the Middle Crisis. Magical universities were founded, and early adventuring guilds coalesced. These adventuring guilds took on their modern form around 200 years ago with the arrival of the most famous adventuring group: the Company of Seven. Formed by Zagyg Yragerne, Keoghtom, Nolzur, Murlynd, Quaal, Heward, and Tasha.  After the party separated, Murlynd, a paladin of Heironeous, teamed up with Munir, a rival paladin of Hextor, and founded the Brother's Company as an organizing and economic overseer of other adventuring groups. The Brother's Company was soon joined by other groups -- the Red Company being their primary competition. Both of these companies swelled to hold almost 300 adventurers each, organized into approximately 75 adventuring crews.

For much of its early history, the Brother's Company had little organization. It operated as a confederation of adventuring crews working together to curb outside competition and set standard job prices and rates. After several decades, however, it became clear that the potential of the Brother's Company lay outside of simple adventuring crews. Murlynd and Munir began to hire out their crews more and more to wealthy patrons, other guilds, and churches seeking paramilitary operatives. Over time, as the Company became sought after more and more by non-wizard patrons, a second branch of the Company was created. This branch, which threw the classic adventuring party structure to the roadside, focused on quickly training entry-level fighters for general employ. It was often not necessary to supply highly skilled teams of mages, fighters, rogues, and clerics together--instead, it became far more economical to simply hire out platoons of meagerly trained spearmen to do the dirty work of the wealthy. The Brother's Company offered some esteemed adventurers positions as training sergeants to support this new endeavor. Even with this new function, the leadership of the Company kept its old form: the group was always lead by a small group of former adventurers. The succession method changed several times over the centuries, even the number of leaders, but the Company has always been an oligarchy.

In the last 50 years, with the rise in tensions between the Cycladenes and the Myriad, the Brother's Company and the other paramilitary organizations began to increase the complexity and rigor of their business. They instated higher ranking officers to oversee training camps and squadrons. They increased their Company size several fold; with each of the Brother's and the Red Companies employing over 2000 lightly-trained soldiers each by 10 years prior to the Campaign, though their number of adventurers remained mostly constant at 300 each. The modern company is headed by five men and women, called Guild Majors. When a replacement is needed, the remaining Guild Majors collectively vote on who to bring into their ranks. The choice is often politically motivated, though occasionally traditional challenges are offered as a means of deciding a replacement.
Over the last year, the recruitment has doubled the size of each Company.

Current leadership:

Valandor Sef - Bard, an eloquent older half-elf who serves as the de-facto spokesperson of the Brother's Company. With a silver tongue and a knack for persuasion, Valandor is generally on-deck to accompany the Guild's lawyers in ensuring favorable contract deals. Despite his smooth demeanor, he's known to harbor a shrewd intellect, a talent for manipulation, and a love for coin and power. His connections and network extends far beyond the Brother's Company.
	- Valandor's under-the-rug dealings generally revolve around sneaky ways to manipulate contracts and avoid lawsuits. Thus he is well connected with various Inspectors of Law around the City, as well as having some recent dealings with the former Archlord of Coin. The dealings with Dariush were minor, often in the early stages of Adnan's plans. They met together, devising the first secretive contracts between the Bank and the Brother's Company. Valandor saw Adnan as an ambitious upstart, 
Elara - Barbarian, a fierce half-giantess imbued with their ancestral power. Elara commands through strength and ferocity, and her steely gaze exudes an aura of intimidation. She has an unwavering loyalty to the Company. She took over the leadership of the battalion while you were away.
Karthain - Monk, dark elf, an unhinged and deeply morbid man, Karthain revels in the bloodshed promised by Hextor. All you really know about Karthain are the rumors circulated by the men of the Company--that he has heaps of parchment pages covered in the last words of the people he's killed, that he was a former Shynedar-Kai assassin before he turned his back on the Cycladenes, and even that he's made a pact with Visha, Shynedar, or Death himself...
Adnan Alisi - Paladin of Glory, human, formerly the rising star of the Brother's Company. Adnan replaced the previous Guild Major, the mysterious swashbuckler Selene, when she disappeared only a few months ago. Now, with Adnan dead, a vacuum once again opens in the leadership of the Brother's Company...
	- Adnan hungered incecently for glory, wonder, sex, and wealth. His desires led him to rise quickly in the Brother's Company, pushing his prodigy's battalion organization to Valandor to secure huge contracts and leverage the growing religious war in the City. Adnan was paranoid, and that got him wondering about the wider implications of his deal and how to ensure he continues his climb to the top. What did Adnan know? He knew that the Mercenaries are giving over some of their profits to the Bank. He speculated that this is because the Mercenaries wouldn't have any of their profits without the Bank's meddling in the first place--that they are somehow responsible for this whole war. He doesn't necessarily care, but it makes him wonder... Why? It's obvious. The Bank makes immense profits out of the war, just like the Mercenaries. Adnan, thus, respects the Bank and thinks of the churches in a condescending light. He holds himself as a genius among men, though he's really not all that smart. He investigated everyone that came near him--including Maximo and all the Crew. He was the one that set Jeffers on the Crew, even though Jeffers was a real Inspector of Law and actual took it upon himself to investigate the Crew and everything they did, feeding info on background and activities back to Adnan.

Gadovan Rahimi - Sorcerer, a high-fey who grew up in Bleakwood, a man whose arcane talents never fit in with the Incantators or the magical Universities. Gadovan felt the academic life was too slow and limiting, and he never felt at home in the industrious halls of the Incantators. He is drawn to power and influence--exactly what the Brother's Company offers. He yearns for the hidden knowledge brought back by so many of the adventurers in the Company, seeing his position as an opportunity to further his own learning and ambitions.
	- A graduate of Prismeer, taught by Tasha. He is an abberant mind sorcerer, a worshiper of the Wandering Stars. He is particularly reverent of Khirad, Hadar, and Delban. Gadovan Rahimi is not his original name, but its what he uses now to fit in more while he is disguised as an elf. He desires power most of all, so that he can return to Bleakwood and elevate himself there beneath the light of the Wandering Stars. Or, better yet, he calls the Stars to Asfalon...

1. There are other important figures as well, such as the key lawyer for the Company: Mazen Tahiraj, a well-regarded master of the legal arts. Mazen is an undead, formerly a _Shubtu-Hukra_, an Inspector of Law, in Touchstone.

Selene, the previous Guild General and a prominant Guild Major, was in power for quite some time. During the early 
The current Guild General is Valandor Sef, elected to this role after the disappearance of Selene a few months ago.

Economics: in the excel sheet.
This is a guild. Members approach the guild, join, and pay dues in order for job protections and enhanced opportunities. The guild's main service to its members is providing contracts and contract management. In the modern world, the guild has begun to take on a role of recruiting as well--it will act as a contracting body in and of itself, rather than an overseer of subcontractors. In this way the guild is one of the most modern in the Last and First City in its business practices.

Example of financial structure for a simple adventuring guild:
A guild has 300 members organized into 75 crews of 4.
The guild operates with 1 clerk for every 50 members, so 6 clerks, and 1 large guild hall to offer residence for crews not on contract. The guild's leadership, a 5-member internally-elected crew, is paid wages of 120 gold-pieces-per-month. At any point in time, about 80% of all crews are employed on long contracts, leaving 20% to be supported by the guild on basic living wages. The guild also offers legal aid, minor social security, and health care. Up to this point, the guild accrues these yearly costs:
6 clerks, paid 60 gold-pieces-per-month: 60x6x12 = 4320 gold pieces
1 large comfortable guild hall, rented at 0.8 gold-pieces-per-day: 0.8x365 = 292 gold pieces
Managerial wages, 5 officers paid at 120-gold-pieces-per-month: 5x120x12 = 7200 gold pieces
Down-time wages for 300x0.2 = 60 members: 60x30x12 = 21600 gold pieces
Legal aid in the form of 2 lawyers on retainer paid 100 gold-pieces-per-month: 2x100x12 = 2400 gold pieces
Social security for the bereaved. The guild is, on average, paying for the social security of about 60 families for an averge of a two year recovery span: 60x15 gold pieces per month x 12 = 10800 gold pieces
Note, this social security payment value varies based on the tenure of the mercenary, the size of the family, and the age of the family.
Health care allotment, in the form of an insurance policy to cover 5 health potions per member per year (250 gp value, 300 members = 75000 policy costing 750 gold pieces per year from the guild)

Total cost of guild without battalions: 4320+292+7200+21600+2400+10800+750 = 47,362 gold pieces per year.
To cover these costs, the guild requires a fee of 55 silver pieces to be paid by the Clients for every gold piece of wages they pay their crew. This, on average, covers the entire cost and nets the guild 158 gp / year for savings. With careful investments and a compound growth of 1% per year, this will allow the guild to save up 27000 gp over the last 100 years.

How does the guild deal with the inherent risk in failed contracts? ie, some guild members die over the course of a contract, which loses the guild the expected dues payments from the Clients. Assuming a 10% risk of death on any given contract, this would increase the social security cost by 50% (5000 gp) for the year (additional 30 families to support with payments). To cover this, each contract comes along with an up-front risk fee payment of 6% of the contract's wage cost (for 60 active crews on year-long contracts, each contract would need to bring in an additional ~83 gp. This is approximately 6% of a contract's cost.) This fee is negotiated for each contract by the guild lawyers--more dangerous assignments bring in a far higher fee. Yearly, this risk fee would bring the guild 5000 gp--but much, if not all, of it would be used to cover the real costs of the risk involved. Estimation of the risk of any given assignment is where the guild can bring in more of its profit. By intelligently assigning crews of skill befitting the contract, the guild can attempt to minimize the actual effect of this risk while still charging the full--or higher--fee. This entirely hangs on the skill and negotiating ability of the two guild lawyers. The Guild has lucked out over the last decades, employing talented lawyers that have used this method to reduce the guild's real risk by 20%, netting the guild an additional 1000 gp / year. This is unstable, however, and so with additional costs factored in (a 0.5% interest growth variance, taking the lower end (0.75% ish yearly growth)) the Guild has accrued a wealth of 100,000 gold pieces over the last 100 years just from its adventuring contracts.

What would an example crew contract look like?
>[!note] Crew contract
>This Crew is to be employed by the Client for a period of 12 months, over which time each member of the Crew is to be paid wages of no less than 30 gold-pieces-per-month, for an expected sum total of 1440 gold pieces. The Client must additionally cover the contract fee to the Guild of 8% of the contract worth, or 115 gold pieces and 2 silver pieces along with a fee of 55-silver-pieces-per-gold paid to the Crew for an expected sum total of 907 gold pieces and 2 silver pieces delivered unto the Guild. The 115 gold pieces and 2 silver pieces will be paid up-front, with the remaining paid over the course of the contract.
>
>The Client is expected to provide ample housing, food, and rest for the contracted Crew over the entire course of the contract...

This gets far more complicated when the Company is contracted to man the Religious War. This is covered in the excel sheet; but essentially it is a large risk. If the battalion is destroyed, the Company loses its investment. If the battalion survives combat, then the Company makes immense amounts of money. This was Adnan's gamble. How can he ensure that the battalion survives? Good training. They will legitimately fight, otherwise they can be arrested for fraud. Their contract pay can also be negotiated to be complicit on the successful completion of objectives--this incentivizes success.

The Brother's Company has likely around 200,000 gp of liquid capital it is has accumulated over its existence.
Adnan negotiated an initial 9 month contract with the Myriad, funded in part by the Bank--though mostly through tithes. This contract partially covered the cost to raise the battalion, leaving the Company to foot around 73000 gold pieces. At the end of the contract, the Company will likely have some profit (linearly between -5000 gp and 22000 gp, depending on battalion deaths ranging from 45% - 90%).

Judging on the first 4 months of the contract execution, the battalion has been amazingly successful, outperforming the Company's expectations by several fold. Seeing this, Adnan realized that he could sell the idea of the battalion to the Cycladenes and get more contracts. Additionally, he can sell the assurance that the Brother's Company will essentially merge with the Cycladenes and halt all contracts with the Myriad--which he never actually planned on doing.
Adnan's deal was a massive one: the conscription of 2 new Cycladene battalions, approx 1.4 million gold piece deal. The Brother's Company can expect to make anywhere from 20-80 thousand gold pieces off of this; effectively boosting their Company worth by almost 40%. Adnan himself would get a cash payment of 10,000 gold for each company.

Overall, the Brother's Company battalion contracts have flexibility that can make them more-or-less risky. The addition of a magical standard decreases the real risk to the battalion, increasing its longevity and allowing the Company to have more stable contracts. They charge slightly more per soldier, but overall the margins narrow. Avg return, 4000 gp. Max return 33000, max loss 30000.

This likely isn't the same expectation as for the *qattarunas/k*, the battalion men, often shortened to *runas/k*.
