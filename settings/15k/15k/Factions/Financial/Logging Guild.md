There are about 1250 each of woodcarvers and wood sellers, each under the umbrella of the logging guild along with the thousands of lumberjacks and cheap laborers they employ in a top-down marketing scheme. They monopolize essentially the entire wood business.

With ~2500 workers making ~60 gp / month, there is a total of around 1.8 million gold flowing through the wood industry every year. With 10% going to general guild dues, that is 180,000 each year going to the guild. Much of this is used, with the Guild able to save about 1% per year (1800 gp.) Over time, this builds up and accrues interest. With the industry growth in the last 20 years, they build up a stockpile of 50,000 gold in their treasury, which is held by the Banking Guild in their Dragon's Rook vault.

The current High Artisan position is held by Zayd Vukoff, a high elf with deep blue skin.
