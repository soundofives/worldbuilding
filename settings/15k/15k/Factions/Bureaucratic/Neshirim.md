**The Lorekeepers**

The Neshirim, known as "The Keepers of Secrets," are a clandestine faction within the Ansharim, and they draw inspiration from the mystique and symbolism often associated with Renaissance-era Free Masons. They operate hidden libraries and archives, safeguarding forbidden knowledge, ancient lore, and arcane secrets. Here are some notable figures within the Neshirim with a distinct Renaissance Free Mason flavor:

1. **Grand Archivist Arion Shadowscroll**:
    
    - Grand Archivist Arion is the enigmatic leader of the Neshirim, carrying an aura of wisdom and intrigue. He is akin to a Grand Master within the Free Masons, responsible for preserving and guarding the most profound secrets in their hidden sanctuaries.
2. **Luminous Scholar Mirabella Nightsong**:
    
    - Luminous Scholar Mirabella holds a high rank within the Neshirim. She is a renowned historian and a master of symbolism, often seen as the equivalent of a Lodge Master among the Free Masons. She oversees the faction's vast collection of historical records and hidden lore.
3. **Sorcerer-Artisan Elara Starwhisper**:
    
    - Sorcerer-Artisan Elara is a master of arcane and mystical knowledge, akin to a Renaissance alchemist. She combines her magical prowess with her understanding of ancient texts to preserve arcane wisdom, a role reminiscent of the Masonic alchemical traditions.
4. **Keeper of Cryptic Secrets, Aurelius Darklore**:
    
    - Aurelius Darklore is the faction's Keeper of Cryptic Secrets, an expert in deciphering ancient texts and forgotten symbols. He holds a position similar to that of a Grand Lodge Librarian in Free Masonry.

    - Thalindra Moondust is the Warden of Illuminated Paths, responsible for inscribing mystical symbols and powerful wards on the doors of the hidden archives. She safeguards the entrance to the Neshirim's sanctuaries, much like the Masonic Tyler.
6. **Artificer-Alchemist Valarian Soulforge**:
    
    - Valarian Soulforge is the Artificer-Alchemist of the Neshirim, crafting elixirs and protective concoctions that extend the lifespan of ancient texts. In the style of a Renaissance alchemist, he plays a pivotal role in preserving the secrets.
7. **Sentinel-Inquisitor Thalia Shadowsong**:
    
    - Thalia Shadowsong is the Sentinel-Inquisitor, serving as the guardian of the Neshirim's archives. She possesses both martial and magical abilities and protects the sanctuaries from unauthorized access, akin to a Masonic Sentinel.

The Neshirim's gatherings are conducted in the tradition of secret societies, with rituals, cryptic symbols, and ceremonies reminiscent of Masonic lodges. They are dedicated to preserving knowledge that could disrupt power structures, and they often find themselves in conflict with other Ansharim factions and the official bureaucratic hierarchy, all while carefully guarding their enigmatic secrets.

Because of their intense secrecy and paranoia, Fraz has made heavy use of the Neshirim, placing his own agents into the organization to interface with the Emperor and the City. 

The Neshirim have a large presence in New Tanore, as they are heavily tied into the administration of the University of New Tanore.
