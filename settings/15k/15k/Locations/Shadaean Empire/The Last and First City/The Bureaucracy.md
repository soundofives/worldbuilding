### Hierarchy of the Bureaucracy
Undead bureaucrats, known as "Zaratann," wield immense power. Their intricate hierarchy is deeply entrenched in the fabric of the empire, governing everything from taxation to arcane research.

At the height of the meritocratic bureaucracy is the **Supreme**, the **Sarru-Zaratann**. The Supreme is always one of the **Sarimah**, the **Bureaucrat Archlords** that form a high council at the top of the government. The Supreme is chosen by the **Emperor** himself, and essentially serves as the voice and representative of the Emperor in the adminsitration. Thus, the Sarru-Zaratann is both the head of state and chief administrator. Their word is law, and they rule with an iron grip over all aspects of the empire.

The Council of Archlords oversee the Empire's major administrative divisions. They create the Empire-wide laws among themselves. The Council acts as a check to the power of the Supreme and vice-versa.
- **Sarimah-Kasu (Archlord of Coin)**: Responsible for managing the empire's finances, taxation, and trade agreements.
- **Sarimah-Shur (Archlord of Law)**: Ensures that laws are upheld and justice is served throughout the empire.
- **Sarimah-Nakar (Archlord of Defense)**: Commands the imperial armies and oversees matters of security.
- **Sarimah-Magya (Archlord of Arcana)**: Manages the empire's magical resources, research, and arcane institutions.
- **Sarimah-Etlu (Archlord of Lands)**: Manages agriculture, land allocation, and resource extraction.
- **Sarimah-Shahr (Archlord of Cities)**: Focuses on urban matters of the Last and First City and other cities. The Archlord of Cities is responsible for infrastructure and dealing with individual city and Pale governance.

Each Archlord is master to a host of Magisters (**Naditu**) who oversee the Archlord's responsibilities in specific districts and provinces. Each Magister's role is ever-changing, depending on the needs of the bureaucracy and the Archlord at the time. While the Magisters under each Archlord are different, each Archlord has at least one **Naditu-Ashru**, the Magister of Records, who maintains extensive archives and documents of the Archlord's domains and doings.

Each Magister charges an army of **Shubtu**, Inspectors. The Inspectors serve as auditors that ensure Empire-wide compliance with bureaucratic regulations.
Some specific Inspector roles:
- **Shubtu-Mashtu (Inspector of Taxes)**: Monitors taxation and local financial matters. These Inspectors and their guard are often seen monitoring the passage of goods through the Gates.
- **Shubtu-Hukra (Inspector of Law)**: Investigates legal matters and enforces justice. The Shubtu-Hukra sit in the roles of judges as well as legal intelligence officers, analogous to FBI agents.
- **Shubtu-Kutta (Inspector of Armies)**: Oversees the readiness and conduct of the military. The Shubtu-Kutta manage the Shadowlands.
- **Shubtu-Usru (Inspector of Arcana)**: Ensures proper regulated use of magic and compliance with magical regulations. Spellcasting and magic used for extra-personal manipulation or magic that harms others is outlawed within the Empire and is prosecuted with fines or harsher punishments.

The endless duties of the Shubtu and Magisters is filed and processed by **Guzalu**, clerks. Clerks make up the majority and the backbone of the bureaucracy, responsible for day-to-day administrative tasks, record keeping, and correspondence.

Serving at various levels of the bureaucracy, **Ziqitum** are apprentices learning the labyrinthine tasks that await them after death. Those that pass the bureaucratic Exams in any capacity serve much the rest of their life in the role of an apprentice. The score level on the exam defines what role the apprentice will take on after death.

The enforcement of the bureaucracy is undertaken by the Enforcers, the **Udummu**. Enforcers are undead that patrol the cities and man the civic spaces of the Empire. They ensure the public spaces are kept safe and that bureaucratic decrees are upheld.

### Factions in the Bureaucracy
The Shadaean bureaucracy is a web of power and intrigue, where loyalty and ambition intertwine. With each bureaucrat serving for a century, they develop intricate knowledge of their respective domains, contributing to both the stability, instability, intrigue, corruption, or cleansing of the Empire. Many members of the bureaucracy pledge their allegiance to various shadowy cabals and secret factions, called the **Ansharim**. These clandestine groups operate in the shadows, influencing the Empire's affairs in ways both subtle and profound. The Ansharim exist outside the official hierarchy but wield considerable influence.

There are four main Ansharim:
- **Qadashim (The Purifiers)**: This group seeks to purify the empire of corruption and moral decay. They work in the shadows to eliminate corrupt officials and uphold moral values.
- **Malku (The Manipulators)**: The Malku are masters of espionage and political manipulation. They gather information, blackmail officials, and shape the empire's politics to their advantage.
- **Neshirim (The Keepers of Secrets)**: The Neshirim hoard forbidden knowledge and ancient lore. They operate hidden libraries and archives, guarding arcane and historical secrets.
- **Reshifim (The Disruptors)**: With a penchant for chaos, the Reshifim sabotage bureaucratic processes, disrupt logistics, and create confusion to achieve their mysterious ends.

Between, within, and without the Ansharim are the **Girru**, the Flies. Flies are informants and spies that feed information to factions within and outside the bureaucracy. They ensure that no secret remains hidden for long.

### Relationships in the Bureaucracy

Much like the rest of the social society of the Shadaean Empire, movement between ranks of the bureaucracy is defined by patronage and largess. Among each rank a constant dance of rivalries makes up a constant undercurrent in the government. Magisters compete for the favor of their Archlord, and the Archlords of the Council compete for the favor of the Emperor such that they might be chosen as Supreme in the next rotation. These rivalries often have wide reaching effects that go beyond the boundaries of the bureaucracy into the realms of other factions in society.
