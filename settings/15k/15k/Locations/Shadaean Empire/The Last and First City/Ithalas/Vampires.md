Before the rule of the Empire, Ithalas was the capitol of a powerful kingdom ruled by royal vampire Clans. The vampires of Ithalas were neighbors-across-the-sea to the grand Heavenly Sinisar Empire, at points under the eye of their conquests. The culture of Ithalas was influenced by the Sinisar Empire, notably in their adoption of the Cycladene Church.

When Ithalas was conquered by Hykhe, the vampire Clans were forcefully quashed--but they did not disappear. Instead, the Clans took to the shadows. Their undead nature made them some of the most enduring members of the Empire, allowing them to scheme and manipulate their way into the upper echelons of society over centuries. Their influence touches most aspects of the modern Empire and the Last and First City, notably the bureaucracy, the Cycladene Church, the Bank of Miros, and the Thieves Guild.

**Vampires in the Council of Archlords**
The Clans have two members in the Council of Archlords: Archlord of Defense Kas tenthlife of Mear, and Archlord of Arcana, Mercy. Both are invariably loyal to Hykhe--though one would end up betraying him, and the other would be exiled to the Shadowfell after Hykhe's death, only to be returned to fight by his side in the Return.

Second to Archlord Kas is the vampire Halmadar, who would go on to kill most of the Circle of Eight after the betrayal of Kas.

**Vampires in the Church and Bank**
Married into both House Duskivaine and House Isher, both families of High Elves.

**Vampires in the Thieves Guild**
From their earliest integration into the Empire, Vampires controlled the crime scene. One ancient Clan, even older than those that rose up from the darkness to infiltrate the surface of society, continues to control the disorganized Thieves Guild. At its heart, the Guild is a modern projection of ancient vampiric rivalries.
