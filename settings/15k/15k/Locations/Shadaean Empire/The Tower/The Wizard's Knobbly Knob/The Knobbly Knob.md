>The Knob is a small, casual tavern hangout of many of the people in the Tower. The Knob is dark and several candles fill the room with smoke. The smoke diffuses the eerie green light of a magical fire. Several round tables sit in the center of the room, and the chairs around them give it a lived-in, cramped feel. The walls are adorned with sketches of events and groups, paintings of patrons of old, plaques of competition winners (darts, goblin's dice, drinking competition), and hundreds of names scratched into every surface. The bar is well stocked and manned by a father-daughter pair of air-genasi refugees, [[Whiff]] and [[Breeze]]. A pair of Charlatan's dice on a string is hung above the bar's barrister with an arrow, a reminder of what happens to cheaters in the Knob.
