Nothing within Faerie is real unless someone feels that it should be. Emotions, belief, words, and names matter strongly here, affecting the ground, plants, light, weather, etc. The dominant emotions of a Faerie Court are those of its Archfey.

The Faerie can be persuaded to change to the will of those who travel in it. A **DC 15 Persuasion** check can cause minor effects, DC 20 and 25 for truly impressive changes. **Intimidation** may also work, though the Faerie might snap back...

Emotions should cause unintended effects as well -- if a PC seems angry, a storm may begin to brew or an earthquake may rumble around them. Happiness might bring sunshine and flowers.

"Time flies when you're having fun" isn't just an expression in Faerie. Time may be fluid and changing.

There are more subtle aspects to this as well. There’s no such thing as a fixed direction, so you can’t just follow a compass to get to where you want to go. You can’t even retrace your steps to get back to where you came from.

The Rule of Three is very real. Make quests three parts, three things in a treasure chest, three paths to follow. Some fey can be summoned by saying their name three times, like Beetlejuice.

## Rules of Faerie

The Rule of Three

No lies can be told?
Fey can tell no lies -- they act as if they are always within a Zone of Truth. Fey will always try to dodge the question, answer vaguely, etc. One way to force a weaker fey to speak plainly is to repeat your question three times.

No Oath can be broken

# Faerie Courts
Faerie courts align roughly with the seasons. From spring to winter, the Faerie courts are bound to these seasons in all ways.  and they must be traversed cyclically.

# The Wild Hunt



# Encounters in Faerie

An ancient green dragon watching over a bridge. He extorts tolls from passersby, and is supported by a nearby fey druid grove who feeds him in exchange for protection. His tolls are art and magic items, rather than gold, usually. Because he is old and gets fed, he sleeps a lot and is lazy.

The Lonely Door. This door isn't trapped. It's not locked. It asks a riddle as the players approach. When they answer, it accepts the answer and asks another riddle. And then another... It will keep this up forever.

I had an illusion wizard conman who had built a small bridge over a river and was charging a toll exclaiming that the main bridge was broken.
