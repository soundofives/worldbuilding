Life among the planes entered its modern age upon the creation of the Astral bridges by Vanimer between 50k BBT and 20k BBT.

The planes in this age are connected by the Astral Plane, the liminal space that bridges all places. The Astral Plane 

Major regions of the planescape:

##### The Unraveling

Fire, Air, Water, and Earth -- the Unraveling are pockets scattered throughout the Astral Plane made of the stuff of dying planes. They are places of elemental chaos, where single fundamental elements reign.
- City of Brass (Fire)
- Fountains of Creation (Magma and Earth)
- Swamp of Oblivion (Ooze, Earth + Water)
- Frostfell (Ice, Water+Air)
- Conflagration (smoke, air+fire)
- Radiance (fire + positive)
- Dust (earth+negative)
- Citadel of Ice and Steel (Air)
- Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls (Water)
- Sevenfold Mazeword (Earth)
- The Isle of Dreams (Dorthyza's Castle)
- House of Knowledge

##### The Faerie Courts
Many of the Courts of the Feywild entered a comatose state upon their death, hoping to latch onto other planes and be nursed back to health. These Slumbering Halls often channel their power into a single great Archfey, a being of each Shard of magnificent power. Many of the Courts have been reawakened, though some continue to slumber in the deep places of the multiverse...

The Slumbering Halls stretch from the Nine Hells to the Seven Heavens, and the loyalties of the Fey stretch an even wider range of moralities.

Nine pieces of Gahenna, the Grey Wastes of Hades, Mycelia, and the Concordant Opposition, these Hells are the homes of devils, daemons, and other unsultry beings. The Hells are ruled mercilessly  

The corpses left behind by Asfalon are a mess. In some cases, unravelling shreds of planar material have come in contact to form new patchwork planes: the Seven Heavens and Nine Hells inhabited by a variety of mortals once resident to the dead planes.

The Nine Hells are nine planar shreds primarily from The Grey Wastes of Hades, Mycelia, the Concordant Opposition, and Gahenna. The Devils here were natives to Gahenna before its fall.
