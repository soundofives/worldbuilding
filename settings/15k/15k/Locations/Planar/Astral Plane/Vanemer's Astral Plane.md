The Astral Plane is a liminal space that connects many of the places in the Planescape.

>[!quote] The Astral Mantra
>**"You have no control over your body - until you begin to think. Desiring a destination, you find your feet moving, seemingly on their own free will, towards the jewel of your mind's eye."**

## Travel

Traversing the Astral Plane is a pilgrimage for a reason. It is not easy, and requires intense focus of mind.
- If you don't have strong enough will, your mind and body will begin to drift towards the plane that most aligns with your persona.
- Traveling for a significant time through the Astral Plane is done in a trance-like state where you are not fully aware of your surroundings. This gives disadvantage on any Perception checks to avoid being surprised.

The Astral Plane isn't "space", though it appears to be one. Trekking through it, you may stumble upon various people or places that either seek you out or you seek out. Merchants, pirates, Dreadnoughts etc may all seek out other travelers. Those who are lost or in danger may seek safety. Nothing happens purely from chance in the Astral Plane.

>[!tip] Travel through the Astral Plane
>Travel is accomplished through either mental focus or through trust in one's own willpower to offset the difference in planar phase: either an Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw is made to make progress in traveling to one's destination.
>Journeying to another plane takes a significant amount of "time", usually several days. Finding something within the Astral Plane is generally much faster -- this can happen instantaneously, or over several hours. Even this, usually, requires a Focus saving throw.
>A failed saving throw means that you begin to drift away from your goal. Even a single day drifting means that you become lost from your group -- resigned to march alone through the Astral Plane. If you fail a Focus saving throw, you can mentally force yourself to push on, taking a point of exhaustion in exchange for a chance to re-roll your save. This can be done any number of times. However, it's important to know that there are no long rests on the Astral Plane -- thus there is no healing and no reduction in exhaustion.

**Drifting**
If someone lacks mental fortitude or willpower, they will drift towards the plane that most aligns with their persona. They unconsciously, uncontrollably, move in a different direction from those they may have been travelling with before.

>[!tip] Helping a Drifter
>If a fellow traveler begins to drift or you come across a lost soul wandering the Astral, you can attempt to aid them, re-focusing their will or pointing back on their path. This is difficult -- it requires you to maintain your own focus while also aiding another. You take a level of exhaustion and must re-roll your own saving throw, but you grant the Drifter an automatic success on their throw.
>
>If you try to force someone to follow a path, you can treat the Drifter as an unwilling prisoner that requires physical constraint, as they continually want to wander off.

Example:
Carric, Koshi, and Rabbitouille all set out into the Astral Plane following their guide, Cailana.
The adventurers can focus on following Cailana, granting them advantage on all Focus checks. One day, Cailana becomes separated from the adventurers. Now, they must make saves of their own to reach the Isle of Dreams.
1 Day:
Carric - 5
Koshi - 15
Rabbitouille - 15

Carric begins drifting, but he tries to force himself back on path. He takes a point of exhaustion and can re-roll his save: 10, still not enough to move towards his destination. Koshi deviates from his own path to go help his fellow adventurer. He points Carric back on the path, but suffers a point of exhaustion in doing so. He re-rolls his save: 18, still safely focused. Carric snaps out of his delusion and is able to follow Koshi for the day.

The more people are traveling together, the easier these pilgrimages tend to be. You can lean on your allies and rely on them for support. Without anyone around, it is easy to lose yourself to the Astral Plane.

>[!hint] Planar Personas
>These are the places that each adventurer would drift towards.
>1. Carric: Abyss
>2. Maximo: Hells
>3. Rabbitouille: Shadowfell
>4. Mysto: Feywild
>5. Koshi: Heavens
>6. Muck: Abyss
>7. Jeffers / Fraz: Abyss
>8. Cailana: Feywild
>9. Yrah (Simulacrum): Sigil

After any interruption in travel, ie combat, you have to re-make your Focus save.

## Environment

The character of the Astral Plane echoes that of the plane that you are closest to. So, as the Crew leaves the Material Plane, the world around them might seem remarkably familiar.

The Astral Plane is frequently beset by psychic winds, storms of thought that batter travelers' minds with lost memories, forgotten ideas, minor musings, and subconscious fears. 
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to  normal in a few rounds. The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers journeying together suffers the same location effect. Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20 twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to determine the location and mental effects.
For the Location effects:
Diverted, add 1 day to travel time.
Blown off course, landscape changes to random plane and add 2 days to travel time
Lost, landscape changes and add 4 days to travel time.
An Astral Dreadnought finds you.

For the mental effects:
1-8 : disadvantage on your next Focus check.
19-20 : fall unconscious for 1 day, either losing that travel day or forcing someone to take a point of exhaustion to carry you.
