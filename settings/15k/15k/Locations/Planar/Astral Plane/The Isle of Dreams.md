>[!tip] The Isle of Dreams
>
>**You pass through the silvery fog into the Isle of Dreams. The scene doesn't quite seem real; swirling clouds and fog sit around the still lake in front of you like a wall, obscuring what might be a distant orange sun. A black and hooked castle pierces the lake and rises upward at an awkward angle, turrets protruding from it like horns. The whole place is lit in a dim, eerie light, revealing a spiraling stairway carved into the rock of the castle's base. Ethereal workers, like half-formed dreams, move barrels of potions on lazy rafts towards the bounds of Dorthyza's Realm.**
>
>Dorthyza's lair, a fragment of ancient planar material suspended within the Astral Plane. The Isle of Dreams is Dorthyza's playground, the jewel of his obsessions and the nexus of Dorthyza's transplanar potion business.
>
>The Isle of Dreams is a very open-ended adventure. In summary, Dorthyza will welcome the Crew in but will eventually turn on them and attempt to imprison them in his Menagerie which is guaded by the dragon Meiddraden. As far as Dorthyza cares, they can remain in his Menagerie forever -- until he forgets about them and they starve to death, that is! Cailana (if she's still alive at this point) At any time, they could attack Dorthyza and set off the Isle of Dreams as a Dungeon Crawl, stage a prison escape in order to catch him sleeping, try to lull him to sleep and attack him in secret, turn Meiddraden against the beholder, free the trapped souls of the Menagerie to their advantage, etc. A lot can happen!

#### The basics of Dorthyza's Castle.

The castle is a cluttered mess and maze of corridors. Stained glass windows and mirrors cover the walls and the corridors and rooms are filled with statues and art depicting daring adventures, monsters, bards, scribes and poets. With each phase of his obsession, Dorthyza unconsciously imitates the jewel of his love in his dreams. His tower is filled with partially real living dreams, ethereal bards and maidens, copies of adventurers long forgotten, and illusory beasts slain in lost legends.

The Castle has several sections:
##### **Central:**
**Entry Vestibule**, a maze of bridges and stairs leading up to the Central Gallery of the Castle. Very open to the air, but set with statues all along it that can provide cover like pillars. Two Ogre minions watch over the Vestibule.
**The Central Gallery**, a tall tapering spiraling staircase running through the heart of the Castle. Bridges shoot off from the center at various points leading to Minion Chambers, the Alchemie, etc. At the base of the staircase, a large open tunnel plummets into the Menagerie. The walls of the Central Gallery are set with statues, mirrors, and stained glass windows. The Central Gallery pinnacle is a circular platform set with a dinner table and a teleportation circle that requires a passphrase that changes constantly. Minions die (geass) if they try to utter the phrase.
**Alchemie**, Dorthyza's potion brewing chamber. Filled with vats of bubbling green potion, the Alchemie is filled with entranced cultists / Bards / Alchemists who are working for the beholder.
**Kitchens,** and other Minion Rooms, serve mainly the Ogres, Bards, and other semi-real Specters.
##### **Lower:**
**Menagerie,** a giant aerie-like chamber set into the hooked base of the Castle. The Menagerie has no floor; it looks down around 100 ft to the waters of the lake (shallow, do not break fall). The Menagerie is a forest of chains and magical cages, like chutes and ladders, each featuring a creature once captured by Dorthyza. The Menagerie is watched over by the dragon Meiddraden, who is perched on a cliffside hollow at the top of the Menagerie.
##### **Upper:**
**Sanctum,** the place where Dorthyza keeps his most prized art pieces and his favorite bards. The Sanctum is lit by its many stained-glass windows and floored with soft rugs and carpets, below which are hidden numerous traps. The only way in is a vertical tunnel from the Central Gallery, via the teleportation circle and passphrase to the Central Gallery, or through the windows on the outside. The Sanctum roof, 100 ft up from the floor, is a prickling mess of crystalline spikes that beautifully reflect the light of the eternal twilight from the windows. Like the Menagerie, several cages hang at different levels from the ceiling (giving the PCs a way to get in the air)

## Dorthyza

>[!warning] Physique
>*A hulking alien head descends, levitating silently, from a shaft in the ceiling. A great central eye, slit like a serpent's glints from above the monster's wide abbysal and toothy mouth that splits its head in two. Ten snake-like eyestalks protrude from the head like limbs, twisting and writhing as they fleetingly glance in every direction.*
>
>*"Welcome to the Isle of Dreams, the perfect confluence of all the greatest stories in the Planescape! I have oh so been wishing to meet you all..."*

>[!tip] Summary
>*Dorthyza is a beholder obsessed with stories, tales, dreams, and adventure. Over his lifetime, his obsession has led him to collect a menagerie of things and creatures to adorn his tower: statues and art depicting daring adventures and monsters, bards and scribes and poets, and even an ancient dragon, Meiddraden. With each phase of his obsession, Dorthyza unconsciously imitates the jewel of his love in his dreams. His tower is filled with partially real living dreams, ethereal bards and maidens, copies of adventurers long forgotten, and illusory beasts slain in lost legends.*

Dorthyza is currently obsessed with the Crew. He was previously infatuated with the Circle of Eight (hence his capture of Leomund), but when they settled down the beholder grew restless. He took to the Crew upon hearing of their exploits and rapid rise to fame, dreaming of a potion business much like theirs. He grew so in love with the business that, as all his obsessions go, he desired the challenge of overtaking the Crew's fame -- almost a twisted way of proving to himself that his obsession is legitimate, he wishes to fail and be shown that the Crew is truly the greatest alchemists around. Given the chance to meet the Crew, he'll gush and enthuse and fuss over them, showing them his grand Alchemie and hosting them for dinner before deciding to imprison them into his menagerie, much like Leomund and his other victims, after which he will go to sleep.


## Fighting Dorthyza

This is a multi-stage fight - Dorthyza is the master of his realm, and he'll teleport between rooms to draw out the conflict.

**Stages Possible:**

- Sleeping (fight his dream shades!)
- Sanctum
- Alchemie
- Vestibule

The Crew does the fight in 3 stages, done in a random order (though Sleeping must be first if he's caught then.)
He'll teleport between the locations after 2 rounds of combat, regaining some health each time.
Whenever he teleports, a window to the next realm opens up so that the Crew can see where he's going.

Further:
If Dorthyza gets to fully sleep, he'll be fighting to stay awake during the fight. Any time he takes damage, he has to make a concentration check. If he fails, he lapses into sleep until he takes damage again. This half-sleep lasts for one stage of the fight ; after that point he teleports to the Alchemie, where the magic of his potions awakens him fully.


##### General Tactice:

-1. Those grappled onto him,
-0.5. If multiple targets can be hit by his Golems,
0. those that can cast Blindness or hurt his eyes,
1. 1.melee users that can fly or otherwise deal him damage,
2.  those that can inhibit his flight,
3. damaging ranged users.

##### Sleeping:
Dorthyza, like all beholders, is a creature of dreams and sleep originating in the ancient plane of Mystery.
Fighting Dorthyza should be easier when he's asleep (since he doesn't get his eye rays...) but not TOO easy, and he should wake up mid-fight.

When sleeping, Dorthyza has reality-shaping powers.
If attacked while sleeping, Dorthyza immediately dreams spectral copies of the Crew's old enemies into existence. They have the same statblocks as the old enemies, but they have only 15 maximum hit points. If these spectres are killed, they flit and whirl around Dorthyza's sleeping form, creating a Weird Wall protecting him. Dorthyza is also damaged whenever one of his Spectres is killed.
**Weird Wall:** *Whenever a creature passes through the wall or starts its turn within the wall, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d10 psychic damage per Spectre that makes up the wall. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.*
**Enemies he conjures:**
(7) --- 1 Shadar-Kai, Survyastra, Medusa, Uzaxuk, 1 Stone Golems, Harmanand, Hag, Troll
If all the Specters are killed, Dorthyza's Weird Wall lasts until the beginning of his next turn, at which point he awakens at 200 HP.
Dorthyza is also awoken when he drops below 200 Health, at which point he awakens in a rage and begins his assault (acting next in the initiative).

When he awakens, he creates 3 Stained Glass Golems and the **Sanctum** stage begins.

##### Sanctum
Dorthyza is slow, but he will try to get out of reach as soon as he can, hovering upwards. He'll use his distortion cone against the largest number of targets he can every turn, preferring magic users if he can. He'll focus his eye rays on:


His Stained Glass Golems act as a scattering focus for his legendary action beams. The golems will try to position themselves around multiple PCs, allowing Dorthyza to spread his beams.

##### Alchemie
In the Alchemie, Dorthyza spills a vat of potion, turning the ground magical. He is immune to the magic, so he'll also douse himself in potion. Then, anyone who hits him with a melee attack is affected by an eye ray-like effect of an Eye Tyrant:
![[Pasted image 20240909153641.png]]
 Dorthyza will try to position himself away from vats and barrels, forcing the Crew to get creative on how to reach him.
 He'll also have a steady stream of **Cultists of the Grand Indulger** he can use if he's getting low on HP.
##### Vestibule
If Dorthyza goes to the Vestibule, he can use his legendary rays to awaken the petrified statues -- Bards and Paladins and ogres -- who fight for him. He, as always, tries to hover up out of reach.


**Add: resistance to attacks made without advantage; can grab onto Dorthyza.**
![[Pasted image 20240829162644.png]]
Modified: Ray burst relies on his Stained Glass Golems. He can target a golem with a legendary eye ray to have it scatter and affect all creatures within 10 feet of the golem.

##### Central Gallery

The Central Gallery is a giant spiral staircase with bridges jutting out of it to lead to other parts of the castle. The walls are lined with mirrors, windows, and paintings. Here, because of the mirrors, he can use his 3-LA Ray Burst effect unless the mirrors are shattered.

Dorthyza can also awaken the statues around the walls into **Voidsoul Specters** to help busy the Crew.

Natural cover: the stair pillar.


---
## The Alchemie

A grand chamber filled with Dorthyza's waking dreams of the Crew's potion making business -- a room filled with vats of bubbling incandescent potion manned by ethereal workers.

Multiple vat bridges criss-cross the room, and a canal-system moves water from one side to another, allowing barrels to be loaded onto rafts and floated out of the castle.

**Rafts fill the canal area, can be steered and moved at 20 ft/turn, and can be sunk - some are manned by Dorthyza's shades.**

Natural cover: none, but lots of barrels and wood to stack up.


---
## Entry Vestibule

**Entry Vestibule**, a maze of bridges and stairs leading up to the Central Gallery of the Castle. Very open to the air, but set with statues all along it that can provide cover like pillars. Two Ogre minions watch over the Vestibule.

Natural cover: statues, but they might turn into enemies!
**A matrix of bridges with buttons to magically rotate the bridges.**


---
## The Central Gallery

**The Central Gallery**, a tall tapering spiraling staircase running through the heart of the Castle. Bridges shoot off from the center at various points leading to Minion Chambers, the Alchemie, etc. At the base of the staircase, a large open tunnel plummets into the Menagerie. The walls of the Central Gallery are set with statues, mirrors, and stained glass windows. The Central Gallery pinnacle is a circular platform set with a dinner table and a teleportation circle that requires a passphrase that changes constantly. Minions die (geass) if they try to utter the phrase.

Natural cover: the central spiral

## Dorthyza's Sanctum


**Sanctum,** the place where Dorthyza keeps his most prized art pieces and his favorite bards. The Sanctum is lit by its many stained-glass windows and floored with soft rugs and carpets, **below which are hidden numerous traps**.

If you don't try to avoid traps: dmg is **3d10** from spike pit, arrows, fire, acid, etc.

The only way in is a vertical tunnel from the Central Gallery, via the teleportation circle and passphrase to the Central Gallery, or through the windows on the outside. The Sanctum roof, 100 ft up from the floor, is a prickling mess of crystalline spikes that beautifully reflect the light of the eternal twilight from the windows. Like the Menagerie, several cages hang at different levels from the ceiling (giving the PCs a way to get in the air)

Natural cover: **nine large pillars around the room.**

---
## Minion Chambers

**Kitchens,** and other Minion Rooms, serve mainly the Ogres, Bards, and other semi-real Specters.

---
## The Menagerie

Dorthyza keeps a collections of people and creatures that have been the subjects of his previous obsessions. Most of these things are either preserved or dead -- except for Leomund, who is kept alive through his wizardly magic.

**Menagerie,** a giant aerie-like chamber set into the hooked base of the Castle. The Menagerie has no floor; it looks down around 100 ft to the waters of the lake (shallow, do not break fall). The Menagerie is a forest of chains and magical cages, like chutes and ladders, each featuring a creature once captured by Dorthyza. The Menagerie is watched over by the dragon Meiddraden, who is perched on a cliffside hollow at the top of the Menagerie.

### Meiddraden

*An aged and wilting dragon, Meiddraden has collected tales and stories for thousands of years -- what's more, he can't shut up about them. Dorthyza is the only being in the Planescape that can not only stand listening to Meiddraden drone for days on end, but actually enjoys it.*

Meiddraden loves talking to people!
