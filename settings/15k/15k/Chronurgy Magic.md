You create a wall of warping time on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall of shifting time can be seen, but is not opaque. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is crushed by the weight of its future, magically aging them by 1d4 age categories to a maximum of Venerable (from Young, Middle Aged, Old, and Venerable). For each category they reach over Young, they take -1 to attacks, damage, saving throws, and ability checks. For each category over Middle Aged their speed is reduced by 5 feet. If a creature would be forced to age beyond Venerable, they instead take 5d6 necrotic damage as they begin to decay. This effect is applied any time a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. The effects of the aging are reversed when the wall is dispelled or destroyed.

When you cast this spell, you create up to four spectral chains and cast them at creatures or corpses within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each chain cast at an unwilling target. On a hit, the target is bound to you and can't use their movement to move away from you unless you allow it.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can tug on a creature's chain, forcefully pulling it 5 feet closer to you. They can choose to make a Constitution save (DC 2) and cum on a success.

At the start of an affected creature's turn, you can drain its life away and grant yourself, another affected creature, or a corpse that stolen time. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, on a failure taking a point of exhaustion and granting you 4d4 temporary hit points, or 2d4 temporary hit points on a success to be given to another chained creature. A corpse granted temporary hit points in this way rises as a zombie under your control at the start of your turn .The zombie dies when these temporary hit points run out or when the spell ends.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action, casting an additional chain.
