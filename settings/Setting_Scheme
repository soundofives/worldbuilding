Eventually, what settings would come out of my worldbuilding?

Cosmological settings, each with overarching villains, story, and setting tropes.

NIMA'S WEFT
--- Abberant Empire looms with an army of slaves, opposed by a righteous psionic sect that created the evil Empire.
    Mind flayers, aboleth, gith, and psions feature in this prequel setting with phyrexian evangelism x eldrazi madness overtones.
    Inspirations from Frankenstein, Terminator, and the Watchmen.

ASFALON AND THE ABYSS
--- Asfalon and the Abyss show down after all other planes are killed; setting closest to classic DnD
    The shards of Nima's Weft are embroiled in a transplanar war of Good, Evil, and Eviler as the Abyss moves to consume them all.
    Asfalon is the last survivor, preparing through a diverse lived history.
    A wide range of setting and genres available here: GoT, Vikings, Redwall, MtG, Metropolis, Fallout/Apocalypse, and more.

- The Last and First City
- The Garden (MTG's Bloomburrow / Redwall style, set in a wizard's garden)
- Wysteria (GoT-like feel of late-Medieval fantasy)
- Winterfall (Low-magic setting where magic is against the law)
- Ilia Before Kalma (Classic, simple fantasy setting)
- Rusva (Post-apocalyptic magic-punk setting with rudimentary tech)

FINAL ASFALON
--- Planar ships journey the unified planescape. A mysterious eldritch evil, Thoon,
    seeks to upset the balance through a new substance: quintessence.
    Pre-modern cults, alien, bio-experimentation, star-devouring, Guardians of the Galaxy, Treasure Planet,
    and Cronenberg-esque body horror in the final setting with sci-fi - phyrexian feel.
