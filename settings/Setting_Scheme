Eventually, what settings would come out of my worldbuilding?

Cosmological settings, each with overarching villains, story, and setting tropes.

NIMA'S WEFT
--- After the Dawn War, when the Abyss was locked away by the Jin and Nima's Weft grew more stable and open to all peoples.
At its height when the Far Ul and Giants warred for supremecy. The Giants were thrown down, leading to an oppressive regime of Dragons.
The Nether Scrolls were written by the Spellweavers and used to throw the plane of the Dragons into the prison of the Abyss, turning
Nima's Weft into Carceri.

CARCERI
--- A setting where planar travel is dark, dangerous, and mysterious. Carceri simultaneously connects all planes and separates them from the Abyss
and the Shards of Clangor. Refugees from Clangor yearn to escape their prison, while those on the outside face a harsh Planescape of yuan-ti, batrachi,
beasts, daemodands, daemons, giants, and others.


SIGIL - CITY OF DOORS
--- Abberant Empire looms with an army of slaves, opposed by a righteous psionic sect that created the evil Empire.
    Mind flayers, aboleth, gith, and psions feature in this prequel setting with phyrexian evangelism x eldrazi madness overtones.
    Inspirations from Frankenstein, Terminator, Innistrad, and the Watchmen.

- Planescape / Sigil
- Innistrad

ASFALON AND THE ABYSS
--- Asfalon and the Abyss show down after all other planes are killed; setting closest to classic DnD
    The shards of Nima's Weft are embroiled in a transplanar war of Good, Evil, and Eviler as the Abyss moves to consume them all.
    Asfalon is the last survivor, preparing through a diverse lived history.
    A wide range of setting and genres available here: GoT, Vikings, Redwall, MtG, Metropolis, Fallout/Apocalypse, and more.

- The Last and First City
    - The Garden (MTG's Bloomburrow / Redwall style, set in a wizard's garden)
    - High Seas campaign
- Wysteria (GoT-like feel of late-Medieval fantasy)
- Winterfall (Low-magic setting where magic is against the law)
- Ilia Before Kalma (Classic, simple fantasy setting)
- Rusva (Post-apocalyptic magic-punk setting with rudimentary tech)

FINAL ASFALON
--- Planar ships journey the unified planescape. A mysterious eldritch evil, Thoon,
    seeks to upset the balance through a new substance: quintessence.
    Pre-modern cults, alien, bio-experimentation, star-devouring, Guardians of the Galaxy, Treasure Planet,
    and Cronenberg-esque body horror in the final setting with sci-fi - phyrexian feel.

- Spelljammer / Voidjammer
