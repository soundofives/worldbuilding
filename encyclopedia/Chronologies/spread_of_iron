Spread of ironworking
-While ironworking in general was developed in Akshah, why would it spread at this time? Ironworking was developed by the monastic Uruvand priests first as a byproduct of bronze forging, but later as a expanded religious pursuit. The "need" for iron was one in the same as the need for increasing armament against the Evil Gods. Bronze was plentiful, but the logistics of collecting copper and transporting it to Uruvand, the tin source, for forging (or vise versa) was complicated. It is cheaper and easier to forge iron. By the time that ironworking is adopted throughout Akshahya, the tin trade out of Uruvand has grown less prosperous. The RGC culture gained a tin source in the Razavah Straights. Nos Mori sources much of its tin from Tellin. The main buyers of Akshani tin are the Suhairians, Wuratans, and the Shileerah (and possibly across the Gairians thru to the Derveman of the plateau).

Key pieces that came together for spread of ironworking on Earth:
1. Societal collapse, breaking established tin trade routes resulting in SCARCITY
2. Power vacuum led to smaller states COMPETING for dominance, forces ADAPTION
    This led to the development of ironworking
3. MIGRATION in the decentralized and changing world of the BAC led to exchange of ideas. Theoretically, this could be done via TRADE.
4. Tied to the power vacuum, COMPETITION encourages not just innovation but also ADOPTION.

In Nomenes:
1. Rising divine tension in Akshah forces INNOVATION without scarcity of bronze. This is a large + powerful state being increasingly and incredibly pressured toward military innovation by their own religion.
    This led to the development of ironworking
2. ESTABLISHED TRADE routes from Akshah via Suhairi, Wurata, Ghahaka, and the Nizuraak and Shileerah carry ironworking knowledge
    2.1 Contrary to Earth's history, ironworking spreads to established cultures and civilizations, rather than spreading during a time of cultural flux. A common theme might follow the idea that increased access to iron CAUSES the social upheavel, rather than being a symptom of it.
3. What leads to ADOPTION in each of these locations? When?
    3.1 Nizuraak would undergo a social upheaval with the introduction of ironworking / influx of many iron tools to their culture. Leads to an Iron Age steppe warrior culture. REACTIONARY ADOPTION THROUGH RAIDING
    3.2 Shileerah shift as well, adopting an increasingly settled lifestyle as iron makes high quality farming tools much cheaper and easier to make and access. Mountain iron deposits abound, making this region increasingly wealthy, though labor needs also increase... SLOW ADOPTION
    3.3 Southern trade routes / conquests (post-Nizuraak of Aramadiz) introduces iron to the south, which is in the midst of a broiling warring period. Competition abounds, making a good case for the expansion of military tech and the adoption of iron. SPREADS WITH CONQUEST
    3.4 Suhairians at the time are in the centuries after the collapse of the Vibhikates. They are transitioning into a new political structure, and this transition + proximity to Uruvand allows the easy adoption of ironworking (allowing future states such as the Suhairian Pact of mercenary cities to thrive on the advanced military tech). SLOW ADOPTION
        3.4.1 Through the Suhairian / Wuratan adoption of ironworking, Damstra and Thandairia are exposed.
    3.5 Wurata is in the same boat as the Suhairian cities, having recently transitioned away from the Isegun Vibhikate with Isegun's death by Kataghrah. The city-state political structure encourages competition and advancement to stay ahead of their neighbors. SLOW ADOPTION
    3.6 Ghahaka / Shatraluki or whatever they're called act as a trade vector of iron across the Palanim + to the RGC via Kanana. Iron to the Shestraluki heartland instigates a gradual transition from Tellin bronze to local iron. This cuts profit off of Tellin bronze industry, though allows the communication of ironworking into Tellin. SLOW TRANSITION
    3.7 Northern cities of the Dewar + the Akobate are exposed to ironworking via Oloto. Oloto is a growing name in the north--perhaps conquest or subjugation of the Dewar cities? An Akobate / Vibhikate war to follow?

ROUND 5 EVAL: Ironworking, just like magic, is a cult practice. The smiths of Uruvand were, from the very beginning, cult practicioners! Their works were integral to the rise of magic and thus can't easily be separated from the religious and ethnic identity of the smiths.

The products of the cult practice spread far and wide as a useful tool, but the cult practice itself needs to be handled more carefully. From its early inception in Uruvand, cult smith practices spread throughout 



================================================================================================
================================================================================================
================================================================================================
ROUND 4 EVAL: New idea, similar to the last. Iron implements spreads through trade extremely quickly, though they are generally expensive. Alinathu becomes a city of smiths, prosperous from the near monopoly of ironworking. In the places that iron spreads, actual ironworking is developed/adopted extraordinarily slowly--unless spurred on by a local circumstance. Essentially, this lets me say that ironworking is adopted at various locations at the exact time that I please it to be.

Let's try it out:

34,000 BBT - Steelworking overtakes the bronze industry in western Akshah.

33,500 BBT - By this time, practically all of Nomenes and Huroma have iron implements created in Alinathu.




================================================================================================
================================================================================================
================================================================================================
ROUND 3 EVAL: New idea. The "spread" of iron implements is NOT generationally controlled. Iron implements are available through trade throughout much of Nomenes quite quickly (within 1000 years for sure). But this doesn't mean that the iron tools are locally made, cheap, or common at all. The spread of the ironworking industry out of Akshah is importantly controlled by movement. Further the ADOPTION process IS scaled by generational length.

So... how would the speed of trade change from Earth? Not much at all. Akshahya is a prominant player in overland and sea trade to its neighbors. But trade doesn't really provide the introduction of ironworking. The main introducer is through conquest or the spread of people who use ironworking.
So... what would cause the movement of Akshani smiths? Initially, Akshani ironworking and smiths are purposfully distributed throughout the empire by Katagrah. Thus, it reaches the Shileerah relatively quickly. Further, the connection of Akshahya to the Wuratan states (particularly Mubara) grows strong by 32,600 ish. That allows ironworking to spread through natural connections to Mubara. The Nizuraak capture ironworkers through raiding, giving them early insight into the process. Suhairian mercenary cities, keen on advancing their military technology, invested significant wealth into importing iron workers from Akshah and the Wuratan states to jump-start local industry. Let's summarize:
    34,000 BBT - Steelworking overtakes the bronze industry in western Akshahya.
    Uruvand smiths -> mandated movement -> Shileerah.
    Uruvand smiths -> immigration -> Mubara
    Uruvand smiths -> mandated movement -> Dronakam and southern Akshahya -> raiding -> Nizuraak
    Uruvand smiths -> trade-induced immigration -> Suhairi
        The Suhairians purposefully keep the secrets of ironworking secret from their enemies AND their client states (Oloto, Damstra).
        Suhairians -> conquest -> Huumbad

These are the limits of the spread of the ironworking industry BEFORE the fracturing of Akshahya. With the splitting of the empire in 32,600 BBT, trade from Akshahya is choked, forcing Suhairians and Mubarans to find new sources of iron. This is what raises the central Wuratan lands as an iron source. Trade from this new source sustains Suhairi AND empowers the Oloto Vibhikate with ironworking industry as they acquire smiths from these Wuratan tribes.

Possibly more important is the dispersal of smiths from Uruvand as the Evil Gods bear down upon the region. Akshani smiths bolster nearby peoples, IN PARTICULAR the Shestraluki. The Uruvand smiths have long borne a tie with the people of the Palanim due to their shared ancestry. Besides the Shestraluki, Uruvand smiths also end up bolstering the          

So, the tech will be "introduced" extremely quickly to surrounding regions but will not be adopted for many hundreds of years. In the case of overland spread, approx rate is 5.25 km/year. For sea spread, 9 km/year.

34,200 BBT - Ironworking is common in Akshah, though carburization is still slowly being implemented as a common practice.

34,000 BBT - Steel is the most commonly used metal in Akshah, including among the Shileerah people of eastern Akshah. Iron implements are a commonly traded item from Alinathu, particularly to the burgening Suhairian cities and the Wuratan cities. From the Wuratan cities, expensive iron implements are shipped to Nos Mori.

33,830 BBT - The Nizuraak are first introduced to ironworking by their raids on the Akshani hinterland to the south of Dronakam.

33,000 BBT - The Nizuraak adopt ironworking. This is the end of a sweeping technological and social revolution throughout Nizuraak territory. Beginning from the center, a single powerful tribe of the Nizuraak steamrolled outwards in a conquering wave. They brought with them ironworkers from the border of Akshah and established small furnace towns and iron trade routes. Iron is acquired through trade primarily with the Shileerah to the northeast. This enhances the connection and "domestication" of the Nizuraak. Their small settlements are enhanced with iron tools, allowing more growth and enlarging the sizes of the warbands. By this time, the Nizuraak are an iron-age steppe people, ready to invade the plentiful lands of the south as a new culture, named after the domineering tribe that brought the revolution: the Oskorameshreh (Great Tribe of Silver and Blood).

32,800 BBT - Uttalagha brings iron smiths with her as she conquers Mubara. This is the first introduction to the actual practice of ironworking to the city, allowing it to slowly grow more self-sufficient.

32,500 BBT - Mubara fully adopts iron forging, and a local source outside of Gadindi is discovered and mined as ironworking spreads northward along the Wuratan coast.

32,500 BBT - Some ironworking tribes from Uruvand are pushed northward by the advancing crisis in Akshahya. They bring smiths to the Suhairi peninsula, spreading the knowledge of local ironworking to the Damstra Dynasty, the new Kingdom of Huumbad, and the degenerating Suhairian Pact.
    Uruvand smiths also flee west to the lands of the Shestraluki. They introduce ironworking here. The pastoral people of the dry hills to the southwest of Akshah before this used primarily easily-worked copper and were slow to fully adopt iron.

32,200 BBT--In a shocking strike, a piece of the Shaasak heartland, the ancient spiritual basin of Tellin, is conquered by an iron-wielding Shestraluki tribe. The tribal leader declares himself Great King of the Shestraluki, heir of the first astar and rightful claimant of Tellin. While the basin had not been of political importance for some time, it still held mighty spiritual draw. Tellin is a place notoriously difficult to invade from the west, and the Shestraluki were tough soldiers. The initial war of the mighty Shaasakids and the upstart Kingdom of the Shestraluki is a disaster for the Shaasakids. This is an early sign of the waning power of the Empire under Vashna. The Shaasakids lose crushing defeats and overspend on arms and armaments for the war effort. With Tellin remaining in the hands of the mountain barbarians, the main source of tin for the bronze of the Empire is severed. The loss of the tin causes an economic crisis as the value of metal skyrockets. The economy of Nos Mori, tightly bound and held by the Shaasakids, is throttled. The economic recession sparks the beginning of peasant revolts throughout the Empire, as some fight for regained independance, a relaxation of tributes or sacrifices or discipline, political restructuring, etc. Instability rises and iron is quickly identified as a possible solution. The people, already familiar with ironworking, fully engage with the known iron deposits--most notably in the Deshgair.

31,700 BBT - Steel is adopted by the Shestraluki. The tribes of the region become a mature iron-age pastoral group. The Shestraluki primarily source their iron from Uruvand. Shestraluki farmers commonly use iron tools, and shepherds defend themselves with iron-pointed spears. As the iron-age world grows more crowded, the Shestraluki find themselves fending off increasing Nizuraak and mountain-tribe raids. Shestraluki elite buid walled refuge settlements.
