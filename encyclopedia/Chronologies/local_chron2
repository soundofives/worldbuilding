The golden-age of the Usvajra civilization continued for one thousand years. During this time, new cities rose and old ones were forgotten. New rulers came to power, and the astar civilization in Nomenes became more volatile. The Aumn brood in Okos had grown even more powerful and arrogant. Skirmishes had grown on the Usvajra’s northern border with the Narazi, but the robust divine continuance of the Narazi made wholesale assault difficult for the rulers of Okos. The deities of the Narazi were strong, and they could smite down an approaching force if the attackers were not careful. The Aumn priest-king captured several Narazi priests and gleaned from them the proper sacrifices to the Narazi gods. The Aumn feigned these sacrifices, called out to the gods with false intentions, and began a campaign of divine intrigue. Eventually, the Aumn priest-king advanced towards Nabashanum with a sizeable force of warriors disguised as a great diplomatic envoy.  The region was mildly poisonous to the outsiders, but it was not acute enough to deter them. The Aumn were advancing not to gather riches or convert to Narazi belief, but rather on an ancient vendetta to destroy their long-standing rivals. The Aumn strike the city of Nabashanum, the home of the ancient Ceris line of sevakath. They betray the Narazi gods. They slaughter the people and immolate the sevakath, even delving into their catacombs and exhuming their hibernating ancestors for destruction. Yuvis, the oracle of the Ruksal, was slain. The sacking of Nabashanum was total.

Taregil escaped, however, in the hands of a young sevakath acolyte who fled east from the mountains. It was not long after Nabashanum burned that the supernatural repercussions began to unfold. The Narazi were, at this point, centralized in their religion. While Yuvis’s oracles had given these cities prosperity and magical foreshadowing, it had concentrated significant religious responsibility on the sevakath of Nabashanum. The sevakath of Nabashanum held key responsibilities in the stability of the region, and with the city and temples in flames, there were none to ensure the satisfaction of the gods of the mountain. The embers of Nabashanum had not yet cooled when the greatest volcanoes of the Wesaxum burst, casting fire and ash into the sky. The Aumn war party stared, terrified, into the sky along with all others within thousands of kilometers. The explosion rocked the continent, and it set off a chain reaction of earthquakes and eruptions of nearby volcanoes. Ash rained from the sky and lightning cracked red in the volcanic clouds. Many of the astar that saw this recalled the ancient stories of one thing: the Usada. The natural disasters brought with them horrible death tolls, but these deaths paled in comparison to the mania that filled the cities and towns of the sevakath. The ash cooled the sky and dimmed the sun, their golden paradise. Crops failed that season and the next,  and the eruptions continued as the Narazi religious community struggled to meet the demands of their divine continuance.
	Riots broke out, bringing more and more bloodshed and staining the divine continuances of the entire region. The following years brought famines and droughts, earthquakes, eruptions, and floods. The climatic effects were followed by a sickening reaction in some Tellinese groups: they would not be resigned to the hell of the Usada again, and the fear that the sevakath may be killed by the disasters put their path to the afterlife at stake. In order to guarantee entry to the afterlife, one must be sacrificed immediately. In multiple sites, mass sacrifices covered temple daises. Pools of blood gathered under the dark skies. Agashurah was practically emptied as thousands of people were willingly slaughtered on the temple stones.
	The inertia of the Narazi divine continuance gave way and divine collapse ensued. The naturally cooler temperatures and mild obliquity of the world at this time took hold.

Hera’rombar, Law, looked down upon the collapsing continuance and worked his fateful magic, pulling winds and waters and animals and plants to ensure the transition of the region. The climatic effects of the eruptions were replaced by a swift equilibrium. It was not long until Agashurah collapsed, followed by the other southern Narazi cities. Those that were not sacrificed fled, trying to find a place untouched by the dimmed skies and the dry, cooling winds. They pushed south into Usvajra, clogging the cities. This push of refugees became an unstoppable force. Cities burned in their wake as they sought any means of gathering food and water. The doors of the great Aumn palace at Okos are shattered, and the luxurious halls are despoiled. Traders from Hradabar and Usna return to the city and see flames rising into the sky. The Usvajra civilization had collapsed under the pressure of the invaders.
	The Huroman traders returned empty handed to their homelands, also ravaged by the effects of the volcanic eruptions. Their people were hungry and angry. Ibowolabara was dragged into the streets and killed, a fate that was shared by numerous other nearby rulers. Fleeting rulers took hold of these cities, though their rules often only lasted months to a few years.
	The Huroman coast is invaded by those fleeing the destruction of Usvajra’s cities. There are no armies to defend the cities here, only bands of warriors just as pitiful as the invaders. Sevakath led the invasion of Huroma, brutally slaughtering the defenders with their undying forms. Hradabar blinked into darkness, the grand stone megaliths of the advanced city fell into disuse. As the more distant Huroman cities sought the trade of the once-great hub, they found nothing to bring back. While they were not directly brought down by the invasions of refugees, their economy began to enter a death-spiral. Some of these cities of western Huroma collapsed, but many simply diminished. Many of those that could left these cities and sailed to the south. Some found refuge in small country farms. All were soon affected by the unstoppable climatic effects of the event.
	Astar society around Nos Mori had collapsed. Those fleeing the disasters of the northern Wesaxum—many Tellinese, Narazi, and Huromans—took to the seas. Many sailed south, some sailed from the eastern Huroma coast back to western Nomenes, to the southern lands of Samadrkir and the Jangatet. Many stayed in Huroma, spreading along the long southeastern coastline. These new peoples displaced others. Skirmishes pushed people inland or into treacherous mountains. The Ghahaka of the northern regions fled east to the coasts of the inner sea Niullumea. Many Narazi followed them. The Ghahaka as a whole were mostly untroubled. The changing climate had only a mild effect on the central desert of the Tuzizamina. The lands in the north became dryer, and the desert edges in the west and south cooled. The seasons became less severe.

At the end of this wholesale collapse of the early astar civilization in Nomenes, cultures were intermixed and spread thin. Cities were small, few, and far between. New settlements saw people far from their homelands. The religious foundations of the Tellin Culture, the supreme rule of the sevakath, was put in jeopardy. The Tellin Culture evolved with urbanization at its core. With the collapse of large-scale urbanization in the cultural center, the Tellin Culture is forced to evolve.

While the Tellin Culture at the heart of the collapse was transformed, migrants at the fringes of the former cultural world clung to the sevakathic system. These societies are primarily the Western Yayurs and the isolated people around Dinaelin, such as the Nemorites. Thandaira was settled by Rajana-led tribes from the mountains, bringing with them local mountain culture and dialects. The mountain culture was similar in many respects to the Tellin Culture, but it incorporated elements of older Pre-Atanosta Amarthian culture and spread quickly due to its non-reliance on urbanization.


 During this time, the collapse of the religious foundations of the Tellinese and Narazi was slow and silent. Without cities to support them, the ancient and proud sevakath began to starve. Fewer and fewer could be supported by the shrinking cities, the roving bands and tiny villages. Many villages composed of mixed cultures saw newcomer sevakath as monsters, and fierce cultural wars ripped through the already wounded region. In these violent times, another Lesser Auhron took the distant field. The Raven Queen whispered into the minds of a terrified few and recruited them. These few servants of the Raven Queen called themselves by many names in the various tongues of the fallen civilizations, they often they were known as Shukun, “Vultures”. The Shukun of this period hunted down sevakath that had fled their people, primarily acting on the eastern coast of Huroma. Here, Shukun and their cults became pervasive enough to head many regional tribes. They spoke out against their undead nature, and some Shukun of Usvajra gathered and destroyed ancient sevakath catacombs. Sevakath were exiled and immolated and forced into hiding. Their numbers dwindled, and the power of the sevakath waned. Some communities still clung to the powerful memories of sacrifice and ritual, but in many cases the sevakath fell from power. They were forced to isolate to survive, becoming hidden demons in villages, nomadic hunters, or monsters in caves.
	This begins a dark age in the history of the astar in Nomenes, where the refinement of the golden age of Usvajra was lost. Progress was not made. Few cities grew, and in general the population thinned as people fell to the hardship of the changing climate.





-East Samisians begin to ride horses by 44000, other domestication was much earlier. This eventually leads to the next step in East Samisian culture... The horse riders ruled the steppes. They bested Nlashikir warriors through sheer mobility. This encourages Nlashikir-East Samisian friendly interaction, which leads to the next culture! Super crazy horse riding half-Orun infertile raiders. They dominate other tribes of prior East Samisians.


-Early trade from Hradabar didnt' reach Eyasol? I think so. Eyasolians are isolationists. More on Eyasolian history later.
-settlements on Eyasol aren't greatly effected by Nos Mori collapse...maybe? They get some refugees + a period of famine. The frightened sevakath might be enough to destabilize Eyasol's divine continuance...but then again, they have sevakath too. Maybe Eyasol's sevakath (more brutal, but less accustomed to organized war) put up enough fight that the refugees are thwarted. Or maybe the refugees find a similar enough culture there that they simply join them. This would make Eyasol the center for the next rise of civilization, perhaps. But the soil there is generally bad. Maybe not center for progressive civilization, but center for evil empire?

-Usvajra vanishes, replaced by Rajana migrant-style sevakath culture. More powerful cults of Lesser Auhrons other than Eres. Eres cults lose importance.
-Southern Narazi culture weakens and splinters, northern Narazi culture hijacked by Orun invasion. Suhairian Orun kingdoms! Divine continuance is solidified by the rapid increase in ubanization in northern Suhairi.
   -Narazi culture survives also in the Cerisian group that migrates through the mountain valleys. The climatic flux lasts about 500-1000 years, during which time Cerisians cross the mountains and trek through the high plateaus until they reach the Rhu Bel. They follow the river to the Samisah, where they settle the river valley until the end of the flux. The Rhu Bel dries up! They move to the nearby mediterranean coast.



-Drying of the Rhu Bel: with the glacial ice in the Wesaxum melted and the monsoonal rains receeding north of Tellin, Dinaelin's output decreases significantly. The contribution of Dinaelin to the Rhu Bel was significant--though there are many other northern rivers also feeding into it. The Rhu Bel during this time weakens significantly and its course shifts.

-The drying up of the Jivita / Rhu Bel wildly affects middle Ghahaka tribes. All the Ghahaka tribes that relied on the Jivita are forced to adapt or leave. The Jivita has tributary contributions to both the north and south, though the drying separated these. Jivitan tribes move into the highlands, both north and south, towards the Wesaxum. They war with current inhabitants, some of which, tribes influenced slightly by their proximity to Tellin, gather in semi-permanent fortified settlements, enclosures similar to late LBK ones.

-Cerisians compete at first with some Ghahaka tribes, though their superior technology quickly ousts the Ghahaka--though they become enemies.
Cerisians come with 10,000 people. Over their first 1000 years they grow little--only to 13000 (0.02 rate). Once they settle the mediterranean lands, though, their rate jumps to 0.04/100. After another 1000 years their pop is at 20000. Maybe rate up to 0.06/100 after this.

40,900 -- Collapse begins, Vayhati Ceris and her followers begin to cross the Wesaxum.
40,800 -- Vayhati Ceris and her followers, after 100 years of wandering and hardship, reach the mouth of the Jivita. N 10,000
39,900 -- These "Narazi" live at the mouth of the Jivita until this time. This is when the climatic flux finishes. The Narazi here scatter around the small bay, which they call the "Akshah" (maybe these people are the Akshani?), "Blue-green River Mouth". N 13,000

13,000 astar in region 130,000 km2. Pop density ~0.25/sq mile, 0.1/sq km. Very small settlements, but very fertile area. Growth rate increases dramatically to 0.06/100 as these Narazi grow without competition. This is a period of demic diffusion throughout the Samisah region. Narazi farmers spread around the coast of Samisah, favoring territories not inhabited by tribal populations of East Samisians or Isikal.

37,900 -- 2000 years later...These people have a unique culture, they are Cerisians. Cerisians get alluvial tin from the red wastes and produce significant Bronze--actually some of the strongest bronze in Nomenes, as some seek tin deep within the volcanic highlands and crystal forests.
    The Narazi sacrificial culture meshes surprisingly well with Isikal beliefs. The two cultures intertwine to some extent, though Isikal tend not to adopt any cultivation.

34,900 -- 3000 years later...They have a population of 260,000. Avg density is only slightly higher due to wide range of population (0.67/sq mile over 1Mm, through all traditionally Mediterranean climate of southern Samisah). The largest has ~9,000 people, with several others trailing it. They begin to grow in social statification. The early period of city state rise here. Maturation of Cerisian divine continuance happens by this time.

-Conflict with Ghahaka, East Samisians, or Isikal? Latter two are very territorial. Most Ghahaka left the region. East Samisians are not the Orun-Samisians, soooo they're crazy. The Cerisians pick up horse riding and advance it--chariots! The worlds first chariots (by 34,500 BBT) marked the sign of further evolution of Cerisian culture. Horses became important to them, but not in the same nomadic way as the new Samisians. The Cerisian brone makes them strong and socially stratified. They have armor and chariots to defend against Orun Samisians.
    -They ally with Isikal on many occasions.

32,400 -- First period of city-state growth comes to a head. After 2500 additional years of heavy growth (0.07/100), the population of Akshah reaches 1.5 million. With an average density of 3.88 people / sq mile, they cover 1Mm. Their largest city is 22,000 people. At this time, this city rises to dominance as a kingdom over others.

32,000 -- A rival kingdom unifies the enemies of the initial kingdom.

30,940 BBT--The prolific Cerisian forgemasters begin to craft some tools from iron--they also forge the first "swords", actually blades for chariot wheels.

30,500 -- The rival kingdom is conquered by the first kingdom, but the conquest was long and difficult and left both urban centers ruined.
    -By this time demic diffusion has brought farming villages throughout river valleys in all East Samisian territory, though these villages are subject to frequent Orun-Samisian raids.

30,400 -- The first Cerisian kingdom, weakened from war with its rival, collapses to Orun-Samisian raids. The first kingdom was notable for megalithic constructions, expansion. The raiders take food, riches, etc, but leave. THey do not attempt to govern.

30,000 -- A new, tertiary Isikal-Cerisian city state rises quickly to importance and conquers the entire territory of the other two kingdoms. This is a new Isikal-Cerisian multi-cultural Empire. The first state-inclusion of the Isikal spreads their culture into the other urban centers of the region.

    -The last 2400 years have been more violent, slowly average growth rate to 0.055/100. This still raises the population of the region to 5.6 million! Demic diffusion expanded the territory to 2.2Mm. Average density: 6.6/sq mile. Largest city is almost 38,000 people!

ERUPTION -- just before this time, the Isikal-Cerisian empire produces artisional + prominant swords. These swords get to the Orun-Samisian nomads as well. Around this time, Orun pilgrimages become common from the Akobate.

The Cerisians are in a unique position. They are a civilized people that are relatively isolated from other cultures that would be sensitive to the eruption and resulting big freeze.
Now, here's something to write about: the climatic change occurs gradually and continually for Vinaltakhans to the south. How does it affect them? The glacial advance is severe, and it digs significantly into Vinaltakhan territory. How do the Vinaltakhans, pacifists, react to this? They have access to grove walking--but only druids. Maybe they help move tribes along spirit lines away from the advancing ice and receding forests? 



--Eyasolian history
-Eyasol has only a small region of cultivatable land. The arrival of farmers causes a boom-bust cycle of population until enough people are driven from cultivation during the collapses. More and more isolated populations grow until they take over all of Eyasol--this is finalized during the Nos Mori collapse, when the last urban center on Eyasol vanishes. Eyasolians become viscious spirit-binding hunter gatherers. Sevakath are few and far between, and fall into legend as monstrous creatures that haunt graves. Dead are cast outside of tribal grounds in order to appease the sevakath.
