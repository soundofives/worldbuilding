What is a reasonable population growth rate for astar, waith, and humans at different points in time?

Hunter gatherer populations grow very slowly--let's say 0.01-0.02/100 per year.

The Roman Empire may have had an average growth rate of 0.1/100 per year, with 5-6 kids per family. My sim says ~5.85 does it.
The Bronze Age Aegean might have had ~0.095/100 per year.
LBK farmers might have grew around 0.051/100 per year, but this slowed to 0.023/100 per year during the late Neolithic into the Bronze Age. LBK collapse could have contributed.
