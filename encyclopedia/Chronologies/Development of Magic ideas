-Supplication
-Divine continuance
-Vancian spellcasting (divine permissive)
-spell writing (with philosophy)
    With mortals writing their own spells, the rate of magical development and applications of magic increase exponentially.
    From here, magic spreads with the Akshani cult deities that it relies on.
    As spells are written by mortals, they are written with mortal power in mind. Before long, spells become more mortal in scope--no longer self-destructive for non natural-epinosts.
    This massively increases the number of spellcasters.
-power control
    With the rapid increase in spellcasters comes the massive increase in magical cult figures. As more cultures adopt cult deities, the traditions are warped and localized.
    The Vancian memory gap is absorbed by a spell component, after which the spellcasting becomes divinely passive.
-Vancian spellcasting (divine passive)
    As magic becomes increasingly decoupled from religion, its tie to philosphy grows.
    Not too long into this process of decoupling, the first developed magic system without Vancian memory gap is created
-Persistent spellcasting, birth of wizardry
    Persistent spellcasting allows another leap forward in magical philosophy and development. With the magical rituals retained, more effort can be put into the development of new spells.
