-Supplication
-Divine continuance
-Vancian spellcasting (divine permissive)
-spell writing (from mature philosophy) - Vancian casting comes from mortals using divine rituals to cast a spell. Why not make your own rituals?

    With mortals writing their own spells, the rate of magical development and applications of magic increase.
    From here, magic spreads with the Akshani cult deities that it relies on.
    As spells are written by mortals, they are written with mortal power in mind. Before long, spells become more mortal in scope--no longer self-destructive for non natural-epinosts.
    This exponentially increases the number of spellcasters.
-power control - The rituals we write are meant for us. We can control their power, and thus our sacrifice.

    With the rapid increase in spellcasters comes the massive increase in magical cult figures. As more cultures adopt cult deities, the traditions are warped and localized.
    The Vancian memory gap is absorbed by a spell component, after which the spellcasting becomes divinely passive.
-Spellcasting (divine passive, initial) - The power is our own, the Gods are gone. We control the magic.

    As magic becomes increasingly decoupled from religion, its tie to philosphy grows.

    Not too long into this process of decoupling, the first developed magic system without Vancian memory gap is created
-Persistent spellcasting (divine passive, mature), birth of wizardry - Maturation of Divine Passive spellcasting.
    ~30,600 BBT
    Persistent spellcasting allows another leap forward in magical philosophy and development. With the magical rituals retained, more effort can be put into the development of new spells.

What next?
Making the divine arcane--magicians in other cultures bring the power of their religions into their own hands.
-Gate magic (Relic Gates)
-Divination (Shaasak augurs)
-Enchanting (cult smiths)
-Conjuration (monsters in Akshah)
-Lichdom and soul manipulation (Akobate, prior to its hiding)
-Necromancy (sevakath stuff)
etc.
The lexicon of spells is expanded through the study of religions. In this way, spellcasting is still often bound to the Autochthonous.
