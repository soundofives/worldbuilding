-Supplication
-Divine continuance
-Vancian spellcasting (divine permissive)
    -"One time use" spellcasting. The spellcasting is divine permissive, and wipes the user's memory of the ritual. Caused as a byproduct of divine-aided translation / mental unblocking.
    -No power control, purely changing the soul focus of the ritual from divine to mortal.
    -Epinosts are the only ones able to survive.

----------
These magical and philosophical developments require a confluence of cultures and ideas. Mobility, competition, urbanism. Also requires a cultural/political atmosphere that accepts questioning of traditions.
What traditions are actually questioned? Magical developments require the questioning and challenging of rituals and the relationship between the divine and mortals. This is theological debate.
Is a time of divine crisis prime for theological debate? It's a time of maximized contact between the divine and mortal I think it's the perfect time for theological developments like these.
"The Akshani Crisis and the Magical Revolution"
----------
Actual philosophical growth can come in another place, probably Nos Mori after the fall of the Shaasakids + alongwith the birth of democracy + republic. This will lead to political, ethical, moral, social philosophy.

-spell modification (from mature philosophy) - Vancian casting comes from mortals using divine rituals to cast a spell. What makes the rituals work they ways they do? How can they be changed?
    -Coincides with writing of magical dogma by Sidakai to counteract Vancian nature of spellcasting.
    -No power control, but existing rituals can be modified through manipulation of symbolic components.
    -Comes with the development of philosophical nature of divine rituals. Aligns with pre-socratic philosophical period.

    -Around 32,360 BBT, by Sidakai

-new spell writing with old symbols - Maturation of Sidakai's philosophy; rituals are separated into their symbolic parts, which can be used to build new rituals from the ground up.
    -Basically first theory of spell componentism.
    -Expansion of literature base.
    -Comes from Sidakai's enclave, towards the end of her time. Coincides with the Socratic philosophical period.
    -Around 31,600 BBT, by someone in Sidakai's enclave

-With mortals writing their own spells, the rate of magical development and applications of magic increase. Platonic Academy period.    
    Philosophy / Magico-philosophy spreads across cultural region, but not far outside.
    As spells are written by mortals, they are written with mortal power in mind. Begins modification towards power control.
    -Around 31,400 BBT. Expansion of Sidakai's enclave

-power control. Philosophical development of new spell component symbols. Big leap. "The rituals we write are meant for us. We can control their power, and thus our sacrifice."
    -Extension of / experimentation on Sidakai's theories and those of her peers in Mubara. Next phase, big leap in theory. Comes out of the Platonic Academy scholarship via empiricism, experiment, etc. Coincides with Aristotle.
    -Around 31,170 BBT, by someone.....

    Changes the accessability of magic forever. Exponentially increases the spread and use of magic. "Magical explosion".
    Rapid increase of spellcasters and spread of spellcasting with spread of people / ideas. Conquest, being conquered, migration, etc, all contribute to movement of magic.
    With the spread of magic, Akshani cult deities spread too. At this point, casting is still divine permissive and Vancian. Magical texts, particularly core dogma from Sidakai's enclave, spread with magic. Local variations of the dogma  
    are created.
    Akshani cult deities are eventually localized after COLLAPSE.

-first structured magic system matures. Mature compiled system of magio-theological arts (Hermeticism) in Akshahya.
    Comes from the magic explosion. Much like the dot com bubble, magic systems pop up quickly everywhere they can. Despite this, one fundamental foundation rules out: a combined dogma of theology, magic, alchemy, and philosophy similar to Hermeticism. This comes with a seminal written work that is diffused.
    -Around 30,568 by someone...
    -Perhaps this is truly just one of many. Mayhaps one system from this era survives the collapse, and is the one to pick up in later civilizations? This era might be the "hotbed" of magic system growth.

-Spellcasting (divine passive, initial) - The power is our own, the Gods are gone. We control the magic.
    This happens as magic is slowly decoupled from its reliance on religion and tied more strongly to philosophy and empiricism. Because other political, social, natural philosophy grows more in Nos Mori, this comes with the development 
    of magic in that sphere.
    -Could also come from a less open religous system; ie, how could these gods allow magic when our gods are far more powerful?
    -Could come from rejection by the religous community; ie "that is the power of the gods! Heathens! Burn! Die!" -- okay, if it is heretical to weild the power of the gods, then why do their gods support them? Is this a purely mortal    
    thing?"
        -Important, then, that this happens near to a place with magic haters / strict religousness. Nos Mori for SURE.
        -All of these thoughts are exactly the same uncertainties that would drive philosophical thought in Nos Mori.
    
    By another... ~30,500 BBT Nos Mori gets their own eq. of Platonic Academy. They have, probably, by this time fully adopted magic (in cultures not afraid of it). Particularly, this happens in a democratic/republic city state near to a 
    magic-hating culture (Thandairia. Possibly most Shasaak...) such that argument and debate is hot.
        -Democratic / republican city state
        -Wealthy
        -Confluence of ideas and people
        -Mobility (sea side)
        -Stable, yet recently so (first period of prosperity after stabilization from Shaasakid collapse)
        -Possibly: Hattargon, or some city south of Thandairia, in the Mahathor region. Possibly an ex-Omanusian city centrally located on the coast of Huroma.
            -In the collapse of Shaasakids, people may have moved around and spread some of these ideas.

-Famous, possibly first true "wizard/sorcerer" is at their height in 30,308.

-This divine passive system doesn't mature until after the collapse + dark ages. Maybe it needs its own "Rennaisance" after a period of purely Hermeticism.
        
-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------
I think this is all that can happen before the collapse.

Not too long into this process of decoupling, the first developed magic system without Vancian memory gap is created
-Persistent spellcasting (divine passive, mature), birth of practical wizardry - Maturation of Divine Passive spellcasting.
Persistent spellcasting allows another leap forward in magical philosophy and development. With the magical rituals retained, more effort can be put into the development of new spells.

What next?
Making the divine, arcane--magicians in other cultures bring the power of their religions into their own hands.
-Gate magic (Relic Gates)
-Divination (Shaasak augurs)
-Enchanting (cult smiths)
-Conjuration (monsters in Akshah)
-Lichdom and soul manipulation (Akobate, prior to its hiding)
-Necromancy (sevakath stuff)
etc.
The lexicon of spells is expanded through the study of religions. In this way, spellcasting is still often bound to the Autochthonous.


Things that still need to develop:
persistent (non-Vancian) divine permissive
persistent (non-Vancian) divine passive
spontaneous casting (spell preparation / sorcery)

What was magic like before?
Magic came in different forms, but it was always tied to religion and spirituality. More than simply being tied in form and thought, it was only the deities that actually practiced the magic as it was supplicated to them by mortal worshippers. Magic before Nihitara was omnipresent through almost all societies. It was regulated more in some than others, embraced more in some than others. In any case, magicians were still a prominant part of dynastic courts and lone forest huts. Magic was a direct link to the divine, and the foremost magicians were prominant in society and myth.

How did the introduction of arcanum change the balance of magic in society? First, we should lay down what Akshani magic was like as it began to spread from Sidakai's enclave:
EARLY:
1. Limited in scope. Magical rituals could slowly be incrimented and modified over years or decades of devotion. Modification didn't come through empirical experimentation at ths time, but instead through pious prayer and religous practice. This allowed magical rituals to slowly adapt to new situations, but it was far from being a tool widely applicable beyond the aristocracy and military.
2. Written scripture aids in the re-learning of spells after their Vancian gap. Successful adoption of this magic generally requires a small group to help re-learn and study. 
3. Tied to Akshani cult deities.
Akshani magic is different from the known magic of supplication in that it was often immediate, reliable, and could be visual and repeatable. It had a visceral effect on the caster and created measureable effects as well. In short, it was much more real.
LATE:
1. Flexible. With the ability to invent new magical symbology and create new spells, magicians can be applied to any societal problem.
2. Skilled work. Becoming a skilled magician takes decades or centuries of dedicated work and devotion. This is only suitable for learned, wealthy, or powerful peoples.
3. Vancian. Effective magic development requires a group of spellcasters to work together and learn when the spell is forgotten by one of the mages. The spread of scripture aids in this.
4. Tied to Akshani cult deities.


Because the LATE phase will affect a wider region, let's focus on tackling that first.
Let's explore several possibilities stemming from the initial spread of such power outside of Akshah:

1. In the vein of Herodotus, the deific connection might be tied analogously to a local deity. But, would that local deity know how to fulfill Akshani spellcasting? I don't see why they would. The Akshani Autochthon that first did this was supported by hundreds of years of burgening trust and belief. A deity from another culture can't be expected just to pick up those rituals and run with them. But, maybe this core idea of "the deities just have different names" developed differently. In the real world, this idea was common and easy to transfer. Ahura Mazda seems like a Zeus character, so he probably is Zeus. But would you ever perform a Zoroastrian ritual while naming Zeus as the primary power? Maybe the languages and names used in rituals are important to the functioning of the ritual. You can continue to believe that Ahura Mazda is Zeus while performing Zoroastrian rituals and invoking the name of Ahura Mazda. So this idea can still work.
    How would this affect the Autochthons? Given enough exposure of a foreign deity to a new culture, the common belief in the syncretic existence of the foreign deity to a local deity could serve to change the local deity to be more like the foreign deity. But a mature deity is not likely to change significantly...why not? If you keep performing their rituals correctly and simply add new abilities, why would the deity be frought to satisfy?
        -A foreign spellcaster comes to your land and demonstrates fantastical power granted by the N'katha.
        -The N'katha seem very much like your own deities of protection and magic.
        -You, intent on learning the arts, spend decades learning and performing Akshani rituals. In doing them, you name your own gods and the N'katha--multiple names, multiple languages.
        -The N'katha are the ones that are truly satisfying the ritual, but the local deities are learning and being manipulated.
        -Over centuries, as this practice gets adopted into society by others and belief in the new powers spreads, the local deity takes on role of the fulfiller.

    Hmm.....But when doing a ritual to "Zeus, Ahura Mazda", the local would still be imagining Zeus. This would invoke the power of Zeus, rather than the one actually able to fulfill the request. This would happen throughout earlier history as well: a deity only knows what it's told to do over long time periods, and can only infer a little beyond that. So, maybe the common idea was that other deities were actually *different*, not just the same deity by different names. It may be more common for groups to understand their their deities are *theirs*, associated with their people and their region. So, when new powerful magic-granting deities appear, their worship could pick up as new cult infrastructure. This could infringe on existing cult infrastructure and cause deific displeasure if it happens too fast. Slow transition from a local magic deity to a foreign one is sustainable, but a swift transition could be deadly.


2. It is viewed as an evil, distrusted power granted and channeled by demons and evil spirits. Those that practice this power are perhaps they themselves demons or evil spirits.
3. Similar to #2, but along a different nuance. Magic is dispised, but because it is heretical, blasphemous, and impious to steal the power of the gods.
    Both of these 2 options result in secret magical spread, public discrimination and fear, and intense bubbling of change and tension.
    All 3 options can exist together, and can vary from persion to person within a diverse region.

Also...what about the nonuniformity of the divine continuance? How does this affect the ability of Akshani spellcasters to spread their arts? The power of a deity depends on the magnitude of belief and the inertial relevance of the person, group, or place.
    a. The Tah-Galin are intertially relevant, and thus the power of the N'katha follows them.
    b. The N'katha grew out of the need to protect Akshah from the Evil Gods. Thus, they are inertially tied to Akshah--and importantly, protecting Akshah. They can only utilize their power if its goal aligns with their domain.
        What would this mean? *Akshani magic is not yet mobile*. This would come from additional magical developments.
        Or....Maybe the thousands of years of Tah-Galin and divine permissive Vancian magic would shift this. The power is mortal; the deities need only to finish the ritual.
        Or...the act of finishing the Akshani spellcasting ritual doesn't actually take much power for the N'katha. It's easy--they're not really manipulating the world, just doing a tiny operation within the mind of their worshipper.

    I think I don't have to worry about the reach of the deities.










Thoughts from drive south:
Magic from Mubara probably shouldn't have general symbology that can be applied to new spells. The transformations happening in Mubara are theologically driven, and so the limit is the decomposition of existing rituals into spell components that can be then rebuilt into similar spells. Essentially, Sidakai's magic is that of DnD's clerical domains, and only derived from Akshani traditions of protection, enchantment, shadow, and concealement (all things relevant to **war**).

At this point (or even slightly before), this theophilisophical tradition spreads around Wurata, then beyond.

Magic is still in its early development: it is limited in breadth and scope, and its Vancian nature prevents mages from holding other significant responsibilities.

So, how does magic initially spread from Wurata? It has utility in war, and who better suited to grab new war technologies than the Suhairian mercenary states? These small, squabling kingdoms bring in Akshani Isakash cults for military gain. From there, they are spread through the campaigns of the Suhairians to Nos Mori after the collapse of the Shaasakids. The violent collapse gives states incentive to bring in external powers to help them get an edge. Tales of eastern mages are too tantilizing to pass up.


It eventually makes its way south to RGC too, though I'm not sure how.

Back to the old question: how does the introduction of arcanum change the societies it reaches?
Well, the Akshani arcanum is inherently a religious institution: it is a deific cult steeped in divine ritual and theology. The spread of the red priests must come with the spread of Isakash cults. So, the spread of magic can, in some ways, be reduced to a less daunting question: how does the introduction of a new, powerful cult affect the societies it reaches? Magic has been used throughout the world for tens of millennia--this isn't new in that respect; but the new power has perks:
    -use at will for immediate gain,
    -utility to war,
    -ability to be learned from scripture.
The Vancian nature of Sidakaic magic also encourages its use in groups, and groups can be expanded. They must have replacement strategies and the ability to spread the doctrine.

How can new Isakash cults be received:
    1. Integrated. They are integrated into the religious pantheon of wider society after longterm use.
    2. Persecuted. Despite their utility, the Akshani priests are persecuted and forced out of a society for cultural reasons.
    3. Inflated. The cult draws incredible, widespread attention. The worship of Isakash is inflated to challenge the roles of other deities in the society.
    4. ??
Which option is chosen is culturally dependant. In the cases where it is brought into society, it comes along with a chunk of Akshani culture. Akshani language and script is used in the doctrine, and Akshani theology is central to it.

The first major zone that Isakash cults spread to is Nos Mori after the Shaasakid collapse and during the rise of city states. This is probably the most important zone to expand to as well. I think I will move the Shaasakid collapse back slightly to align better with the maturation of Sidakaic magic in Mubara and Suhairi. As petty kingdoms and warring cities bubble and collapse for hundreds of years in Nos Mori, Isakash cults are brought in from the east. Though first used only as tools of war, the cults enter into the upper eschelons of a culture where elites are philosophizing amidst the backdrop of extreme cultural and societal upheaval. It is in Nos Mori that secular philosophers distanced from an Akshani cult upbringing philosophize about the expansion of spellcasting to brand new symbology.
    1. Isakash cults spread to new locations.
    2. Locals are initiated into the cult and learn Sidakaic doctrine.
    3. They bring ideas and conversations about the cult to their philosophic circles.
    4. Doctrine is expanded with new symbology drawn from local religious traditions. New spell symbology isn't drawn up out of nowhere: it must come from prior religious rituals or other sources of power. Thus, as magic spreads it picks up elements of local cultures. This gives magic its diversity.
Philosophizing on the cult doctrine and the expansion of Isakash cults has theologic consequenses as well. The relationship between the divine and mortal is called into question, so too is the interactions of the two and their balance. The use of magic can bring with it theologic upheaval--which can be dangerous, and perhaps contribute to the coming collapse.
The spread of Isakash cults around Nos Mori is not universal; Thandairian traditions of skepticism about mortals wielding magic bring persecution and rejection. These ideas, however, help drive the philosophical engine of the western sea.

The spread of Isakash cults to the south has a different reaction. Though I don't have contemporary RGC society fleshed out, Hemangh is a powerful deity able to adopt the powers and traditions of other foreign deities with ease. The god of many faces is a mature deity, and if even a small group believes that Isakash is a face of Hemangh, it shall be so. Hemangh can create a new deific persona to fulfill the rituals of the priests. The RGC fetish with theology might lead to case 3: the inflation of Isakash to replacement of other personas. The persona of Isakash might envelope, eventually, that of Hemangh as the theophilic culture of the south grabs hold of the cult in the public.

Isakash cults get passed up the Wuratan states to Oloto, from there it gets passed to the northern coast and east. How does it affect the Ebo states?
-Theology of the Ebo states is pretty simple: the Akobi is a living god, a representative of the pantheon of deities that is distanced from the modern Orun. The Akobate hasn't really had the challenge of adopting new cults before. The Derveman adopted Ebo beliefs and abandoned their old ways.
