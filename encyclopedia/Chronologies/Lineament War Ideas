Let's think of a back-and-forth war structure for the timeline of the Lineament conflict.

Actors:
ARTIFEX:
Good
Evil
Law
Chaos
Creation
Knowledge
Reason
Ambition
Fear - revived for Certus
Growth -
Shadow - helping Creativity
Creativity - in hiding

CERTUS
Victory
Folly - living around Adliciam, broken
Passion - captured
Revelation - captured
Decay - tethering Growth
Grace - captured
Mystery
Inhumanity

TIE. 1. Growth puts Ehlu into a perpetual coma with the aid of Creativity and Shadow. Decay cements Growth's tether.
ARTIFEX. 2. Power kills Ehlu, the last Neosant. The Trium Planes are formed and the magic of Certus' Lineaments is bottlenecked. Passion manifests as the fury of Certus, transforming into the unending Usada.
TIE. 3. The Shards of Power settle into a planning phase after Ehlu's death. Creativity and Shadow remain with Growth during this time, though Creativity helps plan. Chaos is the messenger. They use their servants, Guire and Selor, to set up a base for Knowledge in The Eye of Ehlu. The Shards of Power create the Heart of Selor, Parmasinta.
4. Inhumanity and Mystery commune with Bash in Andolem; they take him as a servant. Bash is their spy into Selor. He wants to destroy all magic, though the Lineaments use him as a tool, never truly wanting him to attain his goals.

-State here; Selor is an eye for both sides of the fight allowing them to more easily reach and manipulate servants. Parmasinta is a combination of Artifex' essentia, making it a distilled piece of reality-bending power. Lineaments, though, cannot wield essentia--only mortals. Essentia hold a profane power to Lineaments; if a Lineament tries to use the power of planar essentia, the spacetime of a Lineament's demiplane will begin to unravel and they will be destroyed.

(Waith Akh vs Astar + Waith Rhun war, consequence of the Lineament's quest for the essentia. Mystery -> Bash -> Raededir gets cords of Arangil and Taregil and puts them in artifacts for storage for CERTUS.)

ARTIFEX. 5. During the Waith Akh vs Astar war, the Gwenyn use Taregil to capture Passion and trap him in the crystal in the ground. Vanemer uses Arangil to connect the Planar Neighborhood! This changes the landscape of the multiverse forever. Once again, mortals of Certus have demonstrated their power.

CERTUS 6. Apythia further bottlenecks magical energy for mortals--this affects how much the Lineaments of Artifex can find the mortal tethers useful; it weakens Artifex. As this act was happening, it drew out Creativity from hiding to stop the ritual. While Creativity stopped the ritual from being totally completed, the presence of Inhumanity kept most of it going. Growth falls to Decay, and Victory finds Fear within Growth's forest, forcing a tether and reviving Fear into Certus. Reason, Creativity, and Ambition retreat under Shadow's veil.
