The RGC are a violent culture that emerged from the aftermath of a bloody collapse. Massacres, wars, and famine ripped through the south of Nomenes and brought out the grittiest parts of the Zarrakaya people. The multifaced god Hemangh remained, though his strongest faces were those of war. The RGC cities were intimitely connected through Hemangh, and gate-space travel was still possible. Hemangh took on aspects of the violent world, however, and transit was dangerous. The RGC were tightly knit with the Gairians, Sor'haya, and the southern Later Thandairians (those of Velkata). They were farmers, traders, warriors, and pious hermits. A diverse and rich people unlike any others on the continent.
