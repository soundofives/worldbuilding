The RGC are a violent culture that emerged from the aftermath of a bloody collapse. Massacres, wars, and famine ripped through the south of Nomenes and brought out the grittiest parts of the Zarrakaya people. The multifaced god-spirit Hemangh remained, though his strongest faces were those of war. The RGC cities were intimitely connected through Hemangh, and gate-space travel was still possible. Hemangh took on aspects of the violent world, however, and transit was dangerous. The RGC were tightly knit with the Gairians, Sor'haya, and the southern Later Thandairians (those of Velkata). They were farmers, traders, warriors, and pious hermits. A diverse and rich people unlike any others on the continent.

The bustling cities 
---

35,500 BBT--End of Zarrakaya dark ages, start of RGC. Uramuhj, Thupushk, and Dausa are the major winners that rise from the ashes. Start of Jananghu.
    Population 70e6 over whole region; density around 25/sq mile. Doesn't take long to re-saturate into a violent warlike state.
    
    What is the story of the Relic Gate Cultures? These are a new people entering into their mythical age. They live on ancient mounds with portals at their center to a fantastical god-plane that connects them. They are pastoralists and farmers ruled by violent warlords supported by theological fetishists. Entering into a self-supported Bronze Age, cities grow as fiecely independant units endlessly locked together by the mesh of Hemangh.
    The RGC people are separated into three regions, though all are connected through Hemangh:
    Southern Nomenes: Wide, cool forest-steppe extending from the hills of southern Wesaxia, over the ridgeline forests of northern Vinaltakha, to the foothills of the mighty Gairians. Plagued by raids from northern steppe cultures, this region boasts the most ancient mound sites. Cities in the west (notably Kanana) are tightly connected with the Nos Mori sphere, which they trade east. The Vinaltakh is a lush, fertile land, the breadbasket of this region. Dausa, Aramadiz, and Urabdan dominate.
    Azaherem and the Nomenes-Austera sea: The cloistered bay of Azaherem and the islands of Xaraktaru and Ushastadel. Ushastadel is the bridge between Nomenes and Austera, a pit-stop for pilgrims and merchants crossing the sea. It is a powerful bastion

30th millennium: magic reaches the south via Sor'haya?

----------------------------
Development of Hamem:
48,800 BBT: travel through Hamem is instantaneous and by grovewalkers only.
47,400 BBT: others can travel through Hamem with a grovewalker.
46,200 - 43,900 BBT: Savatumra era. Hamem becomes a god-plane, a physical space to travel through. Comes with introduction of Tellinese culture.
    -Hamem manifests as a distant memory of pre-Atanosta Yfanald. A dark place of eternal winter, where the stars are the campfires of ancestor spirits
41,500 BBT: Vinaltakhans discover Oreus, and believe it to be the heart of Hamem.
41,000 BBT: Late Savatumran. Grovewalkers guide large groups through the god-plane. Hamem begins to facet. Gates are centers of urbanization.
    -Hamem has, at first, legendary deific regions. Distant from the explored places, the homes of Hamem's facets are wondrous manifestations of budding gods.
39,000 BBT: Nos Mori collapse; birth of Zarrakaya culture, Hamem becomes Hemangh as language evolves. More expansive and real, home of gods and spirits that regularly manifest. Kashithra is created. Gates are easily accessed, though the god-plane of Hemangh grows more dangerous and populated. New gates are not created.
    -The domains of deities grow and pantheons exert more influence on the beliefs of the people. Monsters and spirits roam the frozen wastes, and Hemangh grows in size. More and more mythical and legendary places are believed into being and discovered by explorers in the wastes. Pilgrims travel the paths and pass war parties on patrol of their lands. Hemangh seems a natural extension of the real world.

36,500 - 35,500 BBT: Zarrakaya population collapse. A lapse in Hemangh transit; introduction of localized beliefs. RGC culture begins. Hemangh is a mature god-plane of many faces and names. The physical gate-space continues to exist, though it is corrupted by conflicting local beliefs.
    -Domination of Hemangh's faces. The very nature of Hemangh becomes local, as facetted realms dominate the god-plane. Now, there is no neutral space--you move from the realm of one local facet to the next. Transit through Hemangh becomes reliant on knowledge and expertise in dealing with your own local Hemangh faces AND those along the way to your destination. 
    -Injection of local myth. The Hemangh "renaissance". "Day becomes night, and night becomes day as the sun is shines shadows and the moon throws glimmering light","When winter is summer and summer is cold as death", "Where spirits walk and mortals float", "Where trees grow high as mountains and swamps plunge into depths unknown."

    -"Devolution" into older, more traditional themes (limited access, mysterious or dangerous travel, mythical dangers and wonders)
    -Generally, more mythical and mysterious. A guide is needed to travel, though travel happens much faster--the world of Hemangh is smaller. The perfect transit takes only five days, no matter the destination.

In order for the local warlords to succeed in their conquests, they need to move through Hemangh. In order to move through Hemangh, they need to use spirit-guides. Thus, there is a boom in the demand for spirit guides which brings a rennaisance of devotion in communities. The enhanced "wonder" of Hemangh in itself greatly increases the people's interest in worshipping it and exploring it. Hemangh takes a new level of focus within the whole RGC population.
Those who control the cities at the maturation of the RGC are warlords who heavily rely on spiritual guides.
