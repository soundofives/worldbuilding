Jotting notes on languages and cultures

Let's start with Yfanald. General pattern:
Unified beginning, radiation as tribes follow Leilom south over millennia. Cultural convergence, linguistic / political diverse solidification.

Languages:
73,000 - astar learn Inivatic
57,600 - Astar language is different, radiated into wide group, "Leilomic" languages, including: Yfanald, Jorosh, Saxum, and Eldh.

Cultures:
73,000 - astar adopt a tribal culture with mythical aspects based on the Vahalis
68,000 - Leilomic cultural group
55,000 - Nixian cultural convergence

Non astar cultures:
Rhun are still realing during this time, not new culture
Akh are the same.

    -North Samisian
        -Sakula
        -Loan to Wuratan?
Proto-Eastern -> Vinaltakhan (Proto Western Iranian)


Thoughts on North Samisians:
Saxum -> Proto-Northern (Nuristani branch) - North Samisians, Suhairians
    -North Samisian Suhairians and Ruksal Thandairians mixed into Narazi culture by 48,400 BBT. Signals a divergence in cultures + languages; Narazi vs. Wuratan vs. North Coast.
        -By this time the process of Saxum -> Proto-Northern is still ongoing. Suhairian language diverges from this early dialect
        -In 47th millennium, North Coast northerners were brutalized by Nlashikir and forced out by 44,500 BBT.
        -North Samisians spread across Suhairi, down the coast of Samisah, across the sea and over the Wuratan coast, and north along the chalk coast. In Suhairi they blended into the Narazi. Along the Samisah they remained independant until they mixed with Akshani in 39000 ish. The tribes along the chalk coast were persecuted widely in wars with Nlashikir slavers over millennia, forcing remnant tribes into the rain forests and deserts (Sakula). Those along the Wuratan coast were left to themselves, eventually mixing with Vibhikate Suhairians towards the end of the Vibhikate period, 37,000 BBT.

        -Nlashikir slavers delivered North Samisian slaves to Akobate from 49,300 -> 44,500 BBT.
        -Darungians develop in 47,600 BBT. They mix with Nlashikir into Tiyara by 42,100 BBT. Why is there a different reaction to the Darungians than to the North Samisians?
            -After 44,500 BBT, do persecutions + hunts of the Darungians increase as a result of the genocide of the North Samisians? Maybe attempts.
        -The southern Nlashikir and Western Nlashikir developed distinctly differently. They had different views and beliefs and tribal cultures, and thus they treated the astar they met differently. The harsh stormy chalk coast pushed the Nlashikir to slaving, whereas the wide stretches of forests to the south of the Akobate encouraged diverse, sparse hunter-gatherer tribes and peaceful interactions. Eventually, after 44,500 BBT, violent interactions DID experience an uptick in Darungir, but the process of Tiyaran development was already ongoing: they fought back against the slavers, and oftentimes the Nlashikir joined their fights.  The tension around the Darungians served to simply increase their exposure with Nlashikir and Orun, pushing the development of the Tiyara forward.

Cultures:
54,400 -- Rhun have to adapt to Post-Apythian nomadic life; culture is changed forever. Also hastens a linguistic evolution.

The culture that awakes in Nomenes is Nixian, speaking primarily Saxum.







































PERAKOR
General idea: Wysteria is site of cultural + linguistic mixing of Akh and remnant Nixian culture. In the north, the astar become nomadic during flooding of the continental shelves. Their languages mix (primarily Eldh) and culture evolves.

Giants arrive!

Langs:
Emakeel (giant)
47,000 - Eldh + Emakeel -> Proto-Amarthian (Proto-Celtic + Estonian)
37,000 - Amarthian (Gaulish + Estonian)

Attasek linguistic radiation due to tribal + fractured nature of Lunima during this time:
50,700 - Attasek language in proto phase, Proto-Davak (from Jorosh)
46,400 - Proto-Davak -> Davak (Proto-Balto Slavic)

42,500 - Davak -> Proto-Yedral, Proto-Pisk, Proto-Voin
41,700 - Proto-Psik -> Pisk (Proto-Balto Slavic + Proto-Germanic),
        Proto-Voin -> Voin (Proto-West Slavic),
        Proto-Yedral -> Yedral (Proto-South Slavic),
        sister to Yedral, Iryes (Proto-Southeast Slavic / Old Church Slavonic),
        Proto-Yedral -> Proto-Hodit (Proto-South Slavic + Galatian)
41,700 - Davak -> Zvir (Proto-Baltic)
36,000 - Davak -> High Bronze Lunimean, Nikartean (Old East Slavic + Gaulish)

38,000 - Zvir -> (Proto) Zjamba, Skirga, Girmis, Ugni, Kexti, VelGabaw
    (mature forms are: Proto-Baltic + Proto-Caucasian, Galindan, Sudovian, Proto-Uralic,Proto-Caucasian + Lithuanian, Selonian

34,900 - Proto-Hodit -> Hodit language group (East (Yezerean), Central (Lokizdun), West (Dazdavecherian) tribal languages). (Galatian+Luwian/Hittite/Lydian)
33,700 - Yedral -> Vulgar Yedral (hyper multicultural Yedral)
32,200 - Pisk -> Vuzthid (Wolf people) (Proto-East Germanic), Yorkfolk (sea people) (Old Norse), Angthed (Pepole of the Song) (Proto-West Germanic), Hwistalari (Gosnazan Pisk) (Old High German)
30,150 - Voinic -> Later Voinic (Pisk influenced Voin)

Iryesian remains

Cultures:
Old Hiid, prehistoric giant culture
51,000 - ProtoHiidkeil, cultural step in the development of full Hiidkeil tribal structure
47,000 - combined Giant + astar tribes; Hiidkeil, combined giant + dark elf culture
46,400 - Abonkeil sedentary culture, sedentary unique version of Hiidkeil culture

50,700 - Nixian+Akh -> Attasek, warrior dualistic chiefdoms
46,400 - Attasek -> Davakrai, change in demographics, social structure, religion, etc after the diaspora
41,700 - Davakrai -> Piskiye, nomadic tribes of northern Ghelond forests.
        Davakrai -> Voin, violent warriors of southeastern Ghelond. Druid mystery cults on the mainland; main culture on the island of Bezebor.
        Davakrai -> Yedris, prolific sailors and astronomers.
        Yedris -> Hoditi, nomadic desert astronomers, counterparts of Yedris
        Davakrai -> Zvir, initial cultural step of warrior chiefdoms in Solnaza.


38,000 - Zvir -> Zjamba, Skirga, Girmis, Ugni, Kexti, VelGabaw; radiation of cultures as Zvir spread across Solnaza and adapt to local environment.
37,000 - Yedris -> Iryesan, Channel culture, mix of sailing and trading and mystery cults of Voin. Masked underground priest cults.
36,000 - Davakrai -> Nikartean; more technologically advanced social structure and values of mainland Lunima.
35,000 - Davakrai -> Ezher, southeastern desert + lake culture, distinct from Mediterranean / forest Nikartean.
33,000 - Davakrai -> Tumyetian, cultural mix of Nikartean and Hiidkeil/Abonkeil after the conquests of Buraan.
33,000 - Ezher -> Ashkeran, drake riders growing in prominance at the end of this period. Drake riding changes culture.
32,200 - Piskiye -> North + East East Luazil, Luazil Sea culture, and East Luazil Foot culture.
31,800 - Hoditi -> Lokizdu, evolution of culture in Yukreka as Hoditi combine with Yedris.

Movements:
43,500 - Davakrai reach Solnaza + Bordostrova
