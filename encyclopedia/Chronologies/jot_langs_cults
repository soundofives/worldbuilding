Jotting notes on languages and cultures

Let's start with Yfanald. General pattern:
Unified beginning, radiation as tribes follow Leilom south over millennia. Cultural convergence, linguistic / political diverse solidification.

Languages:
73,000 - astar learn Inivatic
57,600 - Astar language is different, radiated into wide group, "Leilomic" languages, including: Yfanald, Jorosh, Saxum, and Eldh.

Cultures:
73,000 - astar adopt a tribal culture with mythical aspects based on the Vahalis
68,000 - Leilomic cultural group, 
55,000 - Nixian cultural convergence

Non astar cultures:
Rhun are still realing during this time, not new culture
Akh are the same.

-----------------------
54,800 -- ATANOSTA



NOMENES
Langs:
Saxum -> Wesaxian


Cultures:
54,400 -- Rhun have to adapt to Post-Apythian nomadic life; culture is changed forever. Also hastens a linguistic evolution.

The culture that awakes in Nomenes is Nixian, speaking primarily Saxum.


PERAKOR
General idea: Wysteria is site of cultural + linguistic mixing of Akh and remnant Nixian culture. In the north, the astar become nomadic during flooding of the continental shelves. Their languages mix (primarily Eldh) and culture evolves.

Giants arrive!

Langs:
Emakeel (giant)
47,000 - Eldh + Emakeel -> Proto-Amarthian (Proto-Celtic + Estonian)
37,000 - Amarthian (Gaulish + Estonian)

Attasek linguistic radiation due to tribal + fractured nature of Lunima during this time:
50,700 - Attasek language in proto phase, Proto-Davak (from Jorosh)
46,400 - Proto-Davak -> Davak (Proto-Balto Slavic)

42,500 - Davak -> Proto-Yedral, Proto-Pisk, Proto-Voin
41,700 - Proto-Psik -> Pisk (Proto-Balto Slavic + Proto-Germanic),
        Proto-Voin -> Voin (Proto-West Slavic),
        Proto-Yedral -> Yedral (Proto-South Slavic),
        sister to Yedral, Iryes (Proto-Southeast Slavic / Old Church Slavonic),
        Proto-Yedral -> Proto-Hodit (Proto-South Slavic + Galatian)
41,700 - Davak -> Zvir (Proto-Baltic)
36,000 - Davak -> High Bronze Lunimean, Nikartean (Old East Slavic + Gaulish)

38,000 - Zvir -> (Proto) Zjamba, Skirga, Girmis, Ugni, Kexti, VelGabaw
    (mature forms are: Proto-Baltic + Proto-Caucasian, Galindan, Sudovian, Proto-Uralic,Proto-Caucasian + Lithuanian, Selonian

34,900 - Proto-Hodit -> Hodit language group (East, Central, West tribal languages). (Galatian+Luwian/Hittite/Lydian)
33,700 - Yedral -> Vulgar Yedral (hyper multicultural Yedral)
32,200 - Pisk -> Vuzthid (Wolf people) (Proto-East Germanic), Yorkfolk (sea people) (Old Norse), Angthed (Pepole of the Song) (Proto-West Germanic), Hwistalari (Gosnazan Pisk) (Old High German)
30,150 - Voinic -> Later Voinic (Pisk influenced Voin)

Iryesian remains

Cultures:
Old Hiid, prehistoric giant culture
51,000 - ProtoHiidkeil, cultural step in the development of full Hiidkeil tribal structure
47,000 - combined Giant + astar tribes; Hiidkeil, combined giant + dark elf culture
46,400 - Abonkeil sedentary culture, sedentary unique version of Hiidkeil culture

50,700 - Nixian+Akh -> Attasek, warrior dualistic chiefdoms
46,400 - Attasek -> Davakrai, change in demographics, social structure, religion, etc after the diaspora
41,700 - Davakrai -> Piskiye, nomadic tribes of northern Ghelond forests.
        Davakrai -> Voin, violent warriors of southeastern Ghelond. Druid mystery cults on the mainland; main culture on the island of Bezebor.
        Davakrai -> Yedris, prolific sailors and astronomers.
        Yedris -> Hoditi, nomadic desert astronomers, counterparts of Yedris
        Davakrai -> Zvir, initial cultural step of warrior chiefdoms in Solnaza.


38,000 - Zvir -> Zjamba, Skirga, Girmis, Ugni, Kexti, VelGabaw; radiation of cultures as Zvir spread across Solnaza and adapt to local environment.
37,000 - Yedris -> Iryesan, Channel culture, mix of sailing and trading and mystery cults of Voin. Masked underground priest cults.
36,000 - Davakrai -> Nikartean; more technologically advanced social structure and values of mainland Lunima.
35,000 - Davakrai -> Ezher, southeastern desert + lake culture, distinct from Mediterranean / forest Nikartean.
33,000 - Davakrai -> Tumyetian, cultural mix of Nikartean and Hiidkeil/Abonkeil after the conquests of Buraan.
33,000 - Ezher -> Ashkeran, drake riders growing in prominance at the end of this period. Drake riding changes culture.
32,200 - Piskiye -> North + East East Luazil, Luazil Sea culture, and East Luazil Foot culture.
31,800 - Hoditi -> Lokizdu, evolution of culture in Yukreka as Hoditi combine with Yedris.

Movements:
43,500 - Davakrai reach Solnaza + Bordostrova
