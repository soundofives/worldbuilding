Roman Empire collapses, throwing Europe into the Dark Ages while the Byzintine Empire takes over as the cultural and technological successor of the Romans. Christianity, then Islam spread throughout the Middle East. As Christian Europe rises in the Middle-High Medieval period, the Islamic world (which did not suffer a stark collapse like the West) enters a golden age (8th century). With the mongol conquests and the fall of the Caliphates and the Byzintines, scholarship once again shifted to the West, to Italy. The Italian Rennaisance (14th century) is the unbroken successor to the Eastern scholarship and spurs the Reformation (1517) and Scientific Revolution (1550). The Italian Rennaisance is ended by the Italian Wars (1600)--northern Europe is the successor in the history of technology, theology, and science, particularly Germany and England. The Enlightenment begins (1637) and is ended by the Napoleonic Wars in Europe (1815), after which begins the modern period.

The lesson: technological, philosophical, and theological progress never really stops, even after a major collapse or dark age--it gets handed off from place to place. UNLESS all places collapse.

========================

Wholesale societal collapse in 29k, a "Red Sun" dark age consumes the globe.
Eventually, around the peak of the glacial period ~25k (or later), The southern hemisphere begins again in a second Axial Age and the northern hemisphere restarts again with another late Bronze Age.

Injunction with human-colonized fey shard during the Red Sun

Plane Race, 23k - 21.5k, period similar to mid ADs Roman Empire.
Gate Magic circ. 21.5k, ends with the ability of planar travel, induces spread of disease that begins a widespread dark age. Creates a dichotomy; a European Middle Ages.
Magical, theological, technological, demographic, philosophical revolution. Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, etc, spread throughout Asfalon. Causes a global revolution, possible collapse.

New region rises, Byzantine period. Begins ~ 18.5k, great high point circ. 17k. Castles and early mideaval period grows in another region.
    At the height of this, Revelation is captured. Possibly through some action of this great Empire. This would cause a simifix, leading to great deeds.

Analogous late medieval period ~16k. Also period when Decay is killed and Decay Cult rises. Decline of the Byzantine/Islamic analogues.

=========
circ. 15k Kalma rises during the decline of the previous great Age. He controls the succession of the great Byzantine/Islamic analogues.
Another simifix--during which Kalma, as a powerful wizard, unites much of the world with Gate magic. United too to the planes.
    Golden Age of Kalma's Empire is High/Late Medieval, diverse, including elements of the Byzantines and Islamic lands, of exotic other planes, etc. Leads to a sort of cultural homogenization.
=========

Kalma's Empire collapses in 14th millennium BBT, leads to practically global dark age, disease, etc. Black Death? Demonic invasion?
Leads to rise of advanced thought -- Rennaisance drama, Enlightenment writing, Magical / Alchemical revolution, economic modernization, etc. 13th millenium BBT.

Long Rennaisance, world recovers from collapse of Kalmaic Empire

Shift the Kalma returns storyline earlier! Kalma returns JUST after the Wysteria storyline. ~12k BBT? life of Inhumanity's prison.
Kalmatic dark ages ensue, extreme population drop prevents culmination of Rennaisance w/ scientific revolution.
Magico-tech replaces gunpowder, Kalmatic dark-ages culminate with the Cannons and the Rusva campaign. Magico-tech relies on Crystal, resource under Rusva. Rusva flourishes for a short time, but crystal runs out. (10k)

Dark ages (10k-8k) before a slow rebirth of civilization.

Rennaisance of lost-tech around 7k BBT, Magico-tech is replaced with tech similar to the Cannons; feeding on latent magic. Tiny cannon was already invented by Halifax in the Chalice. Tech similar to this leads to the rise of an early-modern state with central magic power. Circa 5k BBT golden age early modern period happens, but now the planar struggles rise. Demonic presence grows stronger. 1700-1800s-esque period of technological development, but demons and planar struggles slow things down.

"Long 18th century" happens, though no guns. Technology/magic is about infrastructure rather than personal equipment. Magic returns as an aristocratic persuit. Buildup to the Burned Times begins in this period. Great Planar War is approaching.

Burned Times. Demonic invasion, confrontation between Artifex and Asfalon.
