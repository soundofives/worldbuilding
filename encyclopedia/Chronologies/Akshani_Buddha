Very ritualized, daily life involves small, personal rituals in order to divert the attention / malevolence of the gods
Polytheistic, slightly dualistic. Pantheon of evil deities with a few minor, benevolent deities.
Present, malevolent deities
Afterlife is reached through bodily sacrifice post-death, and is open to anyone who accomplishes this feat
Alphabet / runic system is prevalent to record rituals
Warriorship, specifically saranath warriorship, is of high religious importance due to the war with the Evil Gods
Magic is, at first, rarely included in religion.

New prophet changes these ideas how?
Key shift: rise in humanism; mortals have power to control their fate via moral actions
-Ritualization continues, as it is foundational, though it changes in tenor
-Deities that are present+malevolent is basically factual at this point, but the reason behind their malevolence may change. Before, their malevolence was simply accepted without much "reason". With the rise of philosophy, people began to ask *why* the gods were malevolent. Maybe it was because mortals truly deserved this due to their own evil ways?
    -Present, deities punishing mortals for sin
-Afterlife is reached through bodily sacrifice post-death ONLY for those who redeem themselves in life through good deeds / good rituals / "good practice". Afterlife is more heavenly, watched over by angelic spirits and the good deities. Those who are not redeemed are taken by the Evil Gods to become monsters or evil spirits.
    -"Good deeds" and "sin" are defined through the first dogmatic book ala the Bible. Before, religous texts were compilations of rituals rather than guidelines for proper non-ritual practice.
-Fighting the Evil Gods is blasphemous, and pacifism is the path to the afterlife. Saranath warriors are shunned, saranath priests and othe religous infrastructure is still accepted
-The rise of magic increases the power of mortals, giving rise to "mortalist/humanist" beliefs. Mortals have more control over their path and their world. It is mortals that, through their choices in life, control their ultimate fate and acceptance into the afterlife.
