-What is Hehtan doing? Hehtan became a cultist of Eres early, while still in Rhunendor. He and some pilgrims were refugees after the societal collapse there and fled across the ocean, south to Nomenes. They tried to fit into the Orun Akobate, but as Hehtan grew more and more entranced by Eres he stole the Bones of Faranwe and was exiled. He found his next refuge with the Akshani, where he installed himself as a long-time royal advisor to the growing kingdom. His involvement with the Akshani rode behind Eres' interest in them: she and Guire, having re-met over Akshah, wanted to work together to cultivate the Akshani for their own means. Guire wished to protect them from their Evil Gods, and Eres saw a potential in them for the rebirth of magic. The Akshani at the time, having been influenced by the Ghahaka, were performing advanced, semi-independant rituals which Eres saw as a possible seed for magical interest. Eres was not some fortune teller--she had no reason to hold the mindset that "magic would develop". She believed that some magical ritual, if performed with enough power with an artifact like Taregil, could restore the full force of magic that she knew. Her pawn, Hehtan, was the instrument by which Eres wished to gather power and artifacts.
    -She wants to decipher the Bones of Faranwe, which he sets Hehtan to. Hehtan uses a combination of religious prayer and advisors to work on this, though eventually he gives up.
    -She wants to gather magical artifacts. She develops a plan to find the Thief Blade, which she uses Hehtan to execute.
    -She wants Hehtan to gather power. He cultivates the monarchy of Akshah and guides them towards a more magical and ritual society. After Nihitara's magical explosion, he groomed her and began the Tah-Galin to further cultivate magical power. Hehtan wasn't an "experimentalist". Experiments didn't happen. He was a teacher--though he did believe that the power of the Tah-Galin was truly from within, rather than from the gods. He, in attempting to instill this mindset, inadvertently began debates that led to a culture of philosophical thought.

    Hehtan's thirst for power reached a height after his recovery of the Thief Blade. He, along with Eres, plotted to use the blade to steal the power of Kataghrah, after which they would not need to rely on manipulation to get their power. After killing the king, Hehtan was overtaken by his obsession with power. He holed himself away with his enclave of Tah-Galin, every day trying to further increase his power. He was selfish, and admited only those who he believed would help him grow stronger.
-----------------

33,400 BBT--Damstra dynasty spreads north, conquering the southwest of Suhairi and concentrating the remaining Suhairian kingdoms and cities into an allied league, the Suhairian Pact. The Pact is a group of militant mercenary cities. They work closely with Akshahya and the Wuratan cities, and are aligned against the Damstra.

32,800 BBT--Saksugon comes to power and wars with Mahathor.

32,600 BBT--Kataghrah is killed, Adhriguh rules, Akshahya fractures, and Sidakai leaves for Mubara.
    -Pressure from tribes in Uruvand region on Damstra in Suhairi. The Damstra turn to their ancient rivals, the cities of the Suhairian Pact, to aid them.
    -Trade out of Akshahya is choked with the death of Kataghrah and the beginning of the Heavens Gate War. Shaasakid Empire luxury markets shift. Civilizations that imported iron from Alinathu are pushed to find new sources. Wuratan cities, long dabbling in ironworking, discover new rich deposits of iron in their Wuratan mountains. Mubara and the Wuratan cities thrive.
    -The choking of iron export from Alinathu and the focus on the war gutted the economy of Western Akshahya. Treasure from the royal vaults was spent to subsidize iron forges and pay for mercenaries.

32,470 BBT--The Suhairian Pact had grown wealthy from their involvement with the Damstra Dynasty. Mercenary generals grew disproportionately more powerful and independant. One prominent general of the Suhairian Pact betrays the Damstra Dynasty and conquers southern and western Suhairi, forming a new kingdom centered on a site near the ancient city of Agashurah: Huumbad, "City of Mushrooms". The general rules the Kingdom of Huumbad apart from the old Suhairian Pact, which had been growing tenuous over the last centuries.

32,450 BBT--Oloto, eager to spread the riches of the Dewar cities and the distant Akobian Empire, finds an interest in the western Suhairian coastline as a choice location for trading colonies. He founds small trading colonies on the islands off the west coast.

32,437 BBT—The Ashamite rulers of Sthofin break through the Wall of Hata-Andhakar and conquer the ancient Kingdom of Meteshahar. With the fall of the great city of Meteshahar, the southern vassal cities are free of their obligations. All of the cities of the south are independent.

32,400 BBT—Nirnara and its allied cities are peacefully brought into the Shaasakid Empire under threat of bloody conquest. Saksugon rules over all the urban civilizations around Nos Mori, an empire spanning 2.3 Mm. This is the greatest extent of the Shaasakid Empire, and after the folding of Nirnara the empire entered a period of peace, prosperity, and cultural growth. Saksugon is sacrificed and passes the role of empress to a successor: Yashva, "Daughter of Blood".

32,368 BBT-- spell modification (from mature philosophy) - Vancian casting comes from mortals using divine rituals to cast a spell. What makes the rituals work they ways they do? How can they be changed?
    -Coincides with writing of magical dogma by Sidakai to counteract Vancian nature of spellcasting.
    -No power control, but existing rituals can be modified through manipulation of symbolic components.
    -Comes with the development of philosophical nature of divine rituals. Aligns with pre-socratic philosophical period.
    -Sidakai, venerable and post-sacrifice, develops a new theory of spell writing. The influx of people and ideas through her enclave allows this development in Mubara, rather than the closed and exclusive enclave in Dronakam with Hehtan.
    -Sidakai's first written spell is simply a modification on an existing protection ritual. The gradient from spell modification -> new spell creation rolls from 32,400 -> 31,400. It takes some time for this "spell modifying" to spread, as it is not significantly different from prior arts.

32,355 BBT—status quo change in the Masyashan League

32,300 BBT—Around this time, steel becomes common in Thandairia, passed there by trade from the Oloto Vibhikate's colonies. The Shaasakids, embracing the new techniques, spread the technology quickly throughout all their Empire.

32,260 BBT--Status quo change for the Suhairian Pact. Much like the rogue general ruler of Huumbad, a group of generals overthrew the monarchies and other city governments of the Pact and instated a unified consulary out of Isegun. This is the Consulary of Isegun.

32,100 BBT—Iron and steel begin to out-compete bronze throughout all Nos Mori.

32,021 BBT—status quo change for the Shaasakids. The Empire collapses due to political struggles as the culture around the sea warps with the adoption of ironworking.
-The Shaasakid Empire shatters in a succession war after the sacrifice of Yashva. A number of ancient sevakath, including Yashva, vie for power. This high-level struggle devolves into all-out chaos on local scales.
-Nos Mori is plunged into violent wars as local rulers and of the Shaasakids claim power around their territories. Key players: Hattargon, Asraya, and some Desharene cities.


Some pockets of kingdoms remain, though most of the states that rise in the aftermath are city states, all competing for power and wealth.
-The post-Shaasakid Nos Mori sees a massive burst in innovation and competition. Eventually, this leads to standardized coinage in some kingdoms, philosophy, mathematics, drama and poetry, democracy and republic, cooperative leagues and hegemonies, universities, courthouses and advanced judicial systems, alchemy, lighthouses, and a platonic academy analogue by 30,500.

32,000 BBT--Ritual and spell modification matures at the Enclave of Sidakai. Rituals are modified to be of limited scope and power, and the casting of a spell is now routinely possible without risk of severe injury, death, or weakness. At this time, the practice begins to spread as pupils leave the enclave and take up residence across the Wuratan cities. They begin to engrain these modified spells within the religious infrastructure, and further edit them for their own purposes. Spellcasting grows more customizeable and applicable to wider situations.

    -Written scripture!

    With mortals writing their own spells, the rate of magical development and applications of magic increase.
    From here, magic spreads with the Akshani cult deities that it relies on.

    Mubara is pretty centrally located. This spreads as such:
    Mubara -> Western Akshahya, where Hehtan learns of it.
    Mubara -> Oloto
    Oloto -> Oloto colonies
    Oloto -> Suhairian Pact
    Western Akshahya -> Eastern Akshahya
    Oloto -> Dewar cities
    Oloto colonies -> Damstra
    Oloto colonies -> Shasaakids

31,800 BBT—Jungle and savanna culture of Zarrakaya matures.

31,600 BBT: -new spell writing with old symbols- Maturation of Sidakai's philosophy; rituals are separated into their symbolic parts, which can be used to build new rituals from the ground up.
    -Basically first theory of spell componentism.
    -Expansion of literature base.
    -Comes from Sidakai's enclave, towards the end of her time. Coincides with the Socratic philosophical period.
    -Around 31,600 BBT, by someone in Sidakai's enclave

31,400 BBT -With mortals writing their own spells, the rate of magical development and applications of magic increase. Platonic Academy period.    
    Philosophy / Magico-philosophy spreads across cultural region, but not far outside.
    As spells are written by mortals, they are written with mortal power in mind. Begins modification towards power control.
    -Around 31,400 BBT. Expansion of Sidakai's enclave

31,170 BBT: -power control. Philosophical development of new spell component symbols. Big leap. "The rituals we write are meant for us. We can control their power, and thus our sacrifice."
    -Extension of / experimentation on Sidakai's theories and those of her peers in Mubara. Next phase, big leap in theory. Comes out of the Platonic Academy scholarship via empiricism, experiment, etc. Coincides with Aristotle.
    -Around 31,170 BBT, by someone.....

    Changes the accessability of magic forever. Exponentially increases the spread and use of magic. "Magical explosion".
    Rapid increase of spellcasters and spread of spellcasting with spread of people / ideas. Conquest, being conquered, migration, etc, all contribute to movement of magic.
    With the spread of magic, Akshani cult deities spread too. At this point, casting is still divine permissive and Vancian. Magical texts, particularly core dogma from Sidakai's enclave, spread with magic. Local variations of the dogma  
    are created.
    Akshani cult deities are eventually localized after COLLAPSE.



31,100 BBT—Early East Austeran jungle people have expanded along the north coast to the west, by this time reaching the Western Sea.

31,013 BBT—the status quo changes for Navasth.

31,000 BBT—The western northern lake Austeran Zarrakaya populate the western sea central peninsula

30,629 BBT—Status change in Mubara.

30,568 BBT-- first structured magic system matures. Mature compiled system of magio-theological arts (Hermeticism) in Akshahya.
    Comes from the magic explosion. Much like the dot com bubble, magic systems pop up quickly everywhere they can. Despite this, one fundamental foundation rules out: a combined dogma of theology, magic, alchemy, and philosophy similar to Hermeticism. This comes with a seminal written work that is diffused.
    -Around 30,568 by someone...
    -Perhaps this is truly just one of many. Mayhaps one system from this era survives the collapse, and is the one to pick up in later civilizations? This era might be the "hotbed" of magic system growth.

30,548 BBT -- -Spellcasting (divine passive, initial) - The power is our own, the Gods are gone. We control the magic.
    This happens as magic is slowly decoupled from its reliance on religion and tied more strongly to philosophy and empiricism. Because other political, social, natural philosophy grows more in Nos Mori, this comes with the development 
    of magic in that sphere.
    -Could also come from a less open religous system; ie, how could these gods allow magic when our gods are far more powerful?
    -Could come from rejection by the religous community; ie "that is the power of the gods! Heathens! Burn! Die!" -- okay, if it is heretical to weild the power of the gods, then why do their gods support them? Is this a purely mortal    
    thing?"
        -Important, then, that this happens near to a place with magic haters / strict religousness. Nos Mori for SURE.
        -All of these thoughts are exactly the same uncertainties that would drive philosophical thought in Nos Mori.
    
    By another... ~30,500 BBT Nos Mori gets their own eq. of Platonic Academy. They have, probably, by this time fully adopted magic (in cultures not afraid of it). Particularly, this happens in a democratic/republic city state near to a 
    magic-hating culture (Thandairia. Possibly most Shasaak...) such that argument and debate is hot.
        -Democratic / republican city state
        -Wealthy
        -Confluence of ideas and people
        -Mobility (sea side)
        -Stable, yet recently so (first period of prosperity after stabilization from Shaasakid collapse)
        -Possibly: Hattargon, or some city south of Thandairia, in the Mahathor region. Possibly an ex-Omanusian city centrally located on the coast of Huroma.
            -In the collapse of Shaasakids, people may have moved around and spread some of these ideas.

30,308 BBT-- Famous, possibly first true "wizard/sorcerer" is at their height in 30,308. Aligns with Nos Mori Aristotle.

30,000 BBT—Northern Zarrakayans in Austera reach the north coast!

29,968 BBT—Some Akshani empire? Roman Empire equiv. Khanthean Empire?

29,694 BBT|25185 YH—VEI 8 eruption





-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
How does the spread of magic affect the various civilizations of Nomenes?
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
-How do you become a mage? Epinosts are born with magical ability. They are fundamentally different form sorcerers though, which rely on bloodlines--or maybe bloodlines affect the chance of being born an epinost? Anyway, the vast majority of magic users are wizards--those born without innate magical ability, who studied for decades or centuries to become effective and powerful magic users. Proper magical ability requires intense study, memorization, practice, dedication, piety, reflection, service, etc. Early mages were not separate from their religion, they were hermetics with responsibilities not just to their practice but to their cult. Magic is also a learned profession, narrowing the pool to mostly the aristocracy or others wealthy enough to spend their lives beyond agriculture.

So...how do these mages, endemic to the upper class, affect ancient society?

Increased Power of the Priestess: The priestess who possesses this new magical ability would gain immense influence and power. As the sole individual capable of performing these safe and controlled rituals, she would become highly sought after by various factions, governments, and individuals who desire access to the benefits of magic without the risk. This newfound power could potentially disrupt the existing political landscape and create a power imbalance.
------Mages gain immense influence and power. As the few individuals capable of harnassing customizeable and powerful magic rituals, they become highly sought after by various factions, governments, and individuals who desire access to the benefits of magic without taking the time or risk to learn it and perform it themselves. This disrupts existing political landscapes and creates a power imbalance.

Political Instability: The discovery of safer and controlled magical rituals could create political turmoil. Existing power structures, including governments and ruling elites, might feel threatened by the emergence of this new magical power. They may attempt to suppress or control the priestess and her abilities to maintain their own authority, leading to potential conflicts and power struggles.
------The existing power structures of the world and the ruling elite are threatened. The emergence of magical power might drive them to suppress it or control the mages to retain their own authority and sense of normalcy.

Shift in Religious Practices: The role of the priestess and the perception of magic within society would undergo significant changes. The priestess's newfound ability to develop and perform safer rituals might challenge traditional religious beliefs and practices. People may question the authority of the existing religious institutions and turn towards the priestess as a new source of spiritual guidance and magical assistance.
------As a fundamentally religious practice, the spread of magic will affect the roles of priestesses and the perception of power and magic in society. This affects the percieved balance between the gods and mortals and challenges traditional beliefs and practices. Some might question the existing religious institutions and turn towards magic as a new source of spiritual guidance and assistance.

Economic and Trade Impacts: The availability of controlled magic could have profound economic and trade implications. The priestess's abilities might lead to advancements in agriculture, resource extraction, or craftsmanship, resulting in increased productivity and trade. Kingdoms and city-states that gain access to this controlled magic could become economically dominant, leading to shifts in power dynamics and trade networks.
--------The development of magic can lead to advancements in agriculture, resource extraction, craftsmanship, and more. This magical takeover can result in increased productivity and trade as well as shifts in the social structure of a society.
    -However, how much does it really affect all of society right now? Magic is still very rare.

Social Stratification: The emergence of controlled magic could create a new social hierarchy. The priestess and those who possess access to her magical rituals might form an elite class, enjoying privileges and status above the rest of society. This could lead to increased social inequality and divisions between the magical elite and non-magical majority.

Cultural Transformation: The development of new magical rituals could reshape cultural practices and beliefs. Society may become more focused on the acquisition and control of magic, leading to changes in art, literature, and religious ceremonies. The existing rituals and traditions tied to the limited and dangerous magic might be overshadowed or incorporated into the new practices.

Dispersal of Magical Knowledge: With the priestess serving as a teacher at a small monastery, the new magical technique would be disseminated among her pupils. This would lead to a growing number of individuals who possess the ability to perform safe and controlled magical rituals. The spread of this knowledge could potentially challenge existing power structures and create a more decentralized system of magical practitioners.

Formation of Magical Communities: The pupils trained by the priestess would form their own magical communities, sharing and developing their understanding of the new magical rituals. These communities could become centers of knowledge and expertise, attracting individuals seeking magical assistance or guidance. The influence and power of these communities might grow, leading to the emergence of new social dynamics and alliances.

Collaboration and Innovation: As more individuals gain access to safe and controlled magic, collaborative efforts and innovation would likely increase. The pupils of the priestess, with their newfound abilities, could experiment, refine, and develop further magical techniques. This could result in a continuous evolution of magical practices and the emergence of diverse magical traditions within the society.

Challenges to Traditional Power Structures: The proliferation of individuals with magical abilities could challenge existing power structures, including governments and religious institutions. The decentralized nature of magical knowledge would provide individuals with alternative sources of power and influence. This might lead to tensions and conflicts with established authorities, as they attempt to assert control or suppress the influence of these magical communities.

Cultural Integration: The spread of the new magical technique would likely influence cultural practices and beliefs. Magical rituals and beliefs might become more ingrained in everyday life, shaping art, literature, and religious ceremonies. Society may develop a greater acceptance and integration of magic, resulting in the emergence of new cultural traditions and customs.

Social Cohesion and Cooperation: The magical communities formed by the pupils of the priestess could foster a sense of camaraderie and cooperation. These communities might collaborate on various endeavors, such as problem-solving, protection against external threats, or advancing societal goals. This could lead to increased social cohesion and a sense of shared purpose among the practitioners of safe and controlled magic.






















32,370 BBT—Over time, the Arihan monasteries of Kandaraska and Khanthiur produced the first personally written spell, one that allowed the caster to understand all languages. The magic of these monasteries had long been leaning towards ritual components as symbolic things, separable in nature. As this idea matured, divine communication allowed the “discovery” of new symbols and the creation of new rituals meant only for use by mortals to channel their own magic. With the ability to comprehend all languages, the Arihan of Khanthiur and Kandaraska decipher the Bones of Faranwe, learning about Corilyan Flow and Shaping. While they cannot simply exercise these powers like the Gwenyn or pre-Apythian magicians, they do learn about the nature of the Trium, the flow of magic through the nexus (or soul, as it is viewed), and the aphysicality of Corilya and its connection to Mediul. Knowledge is power for these early spell writers, as once they have knowledge of a concept they can acquire symbolic representations of it, allowing them to focus their minds and translate the magical intent through their nexus. So, having knowledge of the Trium planes allows them to seek spells to interface, learn from, or 
, which teaches him the concepts of Corilyan Flow and Corilyan Shaping. Corilyan Flow requires an understanding of the flow of magic from Corilya through Asfalon into Andolem. Corilyan Shaping teaches the concept of the aphysicality of Corilya, and generally teaches the shape of the Trium. This begins magical philosophy and spell writing. As his Tah-Galin learn to write spells, they slowly hone the craft to a level of mastery. Sometime around 32,000 BBT Khanthiur is sacked (by whom?). Tah-Galin are scattered to the winds, slowly spreading the art of spellwriting around Akshah (and slightly beyond).



32,000 BBT—Buddha-esque spiritual figure rises in Akshah, beginning a new religious sect that spreads quickly through the vulnerable land.
A short description of Late Akshani spirituality might follow this framework: Daily life for a spiritual Akshani is very ritualized, with small, personal rituals and regular larger rituals used to protect the individual from the wrath of the evil gods. Akshah holds a polytheistic, slightly dualistic pantheon of practically factual gods. Evil deities actively manifest in the land, conjuring monsters and spirits and causing mayhem. Several benevolent minor deities exist as well, with their primary focus around the martial support of the Arihan, the war-clerics and paladins of the Akshani. Generally, Akshani afterlife is reached through bodily sacrifice post-death, and it is open to anyone who accomplishes this requirement. The bodily sacrifice not only serves to create a “bridge of blood” to the afterlife, but for the Akshani it also There is a single afterlife controlled by the evil gods
Afterlife is reached through bodily sacrifice post-death, and is open to anyone who accomplishes this feat
Alphabet / runic system is prevalent to record rituals
Warriorship, specifically saranath warriorship, is of high religious importance due to the war with the Evil Gods
Magic is, at first, rarely included in religion.

New prophet changes these ideas how?
Key shift: rise in humanism; mortals have power to control their fate via moral actions
-Ritualization continues, as it is foundational, though it changes in tenor
-Deities that are present+malevolent is basically factual at this point, but the reason behind their malevolence may change. Before, their malevolence was simply accepted without much "reason". With the rise of philosophy, people began to ask *why* the gods were malevolent. Maybe it was because mortals truly deserved this due to their own evil ways?
    -Present, deities punishing mortals for sin
-Afterlife is reached through bodily sacrifice post-death ONLY for those who redeem themselves in life through good deeds / good rituals / "good practice". Afterlife is more heavenly, watched over by angelic spirits and the good deities. Those who are not redeemed are taken by the Evil Gods to become monsters or evil spirits.
    -"Good deeds" and "sin" are defined through the first dogmatic book ala the Bible. Before, religous texts were compilations of rituals rather than guidelines for proper non-ritual practice.
-Fighting the Evil Gods is blasphemous, and pacifism is the path to the afterlife. Saranath warriors are shunned, saranath priests and othe religous infrastructure is still accepted
-The rise of magic increases the power of mortals, giving rise to "mortalist/humanist" beliefs. Mortals have more control over their path and their world. It is mortals that, through their choices in life, control their ultimate fate and acceptance into the afterlife.

First preacher of this new sect is an Arihan who founds their first monastery after escaping the sack of Khanthiur in 32,000 BBT.

So, what happens?
As trees burned to forge a forest of swords, figures rose across Akshahya: 
new prophets (ala Buddha, around 32,000 BBT) and religious sects,
economic systems of coinage to stabilize the war-torn cities, philosophical rulers questioning the end of their world, and thespians and historians telling the stories of the collapse of Akshahya.
	New schools of Tah-Galin were formed practicing both magic and alchemy, though none were as successful as Mear Adriguh-Kataghrah’s in Khanthiur. Khanthiur is the site of horrific magical experimentation by Hehtan (sacrifice of many saranath), 

By 31,400 BBT, magic is prevalent enough that Tah-Galin can finely control spell power, exponentially increasing the accessibility of magic. At this point, an elite academy (ala Plato’s) is created and the finest mages in Akshahya are gathered. Magic spreads quickly as the Tah-Galin travel to battle monsters. The war with the Evil Gods continues to grow, however.

31,500 BBT—Spellcasting reaches Nos Mori, but it is denied (until after the coming Collapse).

30,700 BBT—Pressure from the far south builds up, violence increases in Relic Gate territory.

30,560 BBT—Persistent spellcasting is created. Minor Gate magic is being used by Relic Gate mages (divine permissive). Pressure reach a boiling point in Relic Gate culture. Migrations begin, slowly.

Pressures grow too strong for Relic Gate people to ignore, mass exodus begins. Some escape north, some escape to Hemangh + east. Gate magic is invented, allowing custom entry + exit of Hemangh. Relic Gate mages can appear anywhere, instantly. Mages from Uramuhj develop Gate magic.

30,300 BBT—Relic Gate invasions begin in earnest. Mages and armies travel through Hemangh and uses gates to appear behind enemy lines, instantly. The mages that can accomplish this are epinosts, typically born and trained in Uramuhj. They spread through Relic Gate territory like traveling smiths, lending their powers. There is no known counter for this tactic, though only a handful of mages can actually accomplish the feat. Relic Gate divine continuance collapses in Nomenes. Relic Gate dark ages begin.

30,000 BBT—Northern societies crumble under the Relic Gate invasions. Hehtan learns Gate magic. He now believes he is powerful enough to force a god through the Heaven Gate by sacrificing many saranath. He will target the most powerful of the evil gods. Once he kills one, he can steal its power and destroy the others.

29,900 BBT—Hehtan opens the Heaven Gate, successfully kills an Evil God, reaches apotheosis (though it is weakened due to the ensuing collapse of Akshah), and uses his new power to kill almost all the Evil Gods. He gathers all their power, one after the next.

29,800 BBT—Hehtan, all powerful, seeks to kill all other gods. He calls in challenge to Alaafia. He gathers his strength.

29,700 BBT—At this point, Alaafia’s armies approach and Alaafia battles with god-Hehtan. Alaafia’s council of augurs warned her that Hehtan would be the cause of the end of the Akobate, and she believes it is her destiny to stop him. The two Apotheids are evenly matched, as both have millions of followers contributing to their nexus. Alaafia cannot beat him, so she blows up the hot spot and retreats, hiding the core of the Akobate away, as now her people have learned magic too. Their powerful mages hide the land away from any who would come near. It becomes almost like a Gate-space. Alaafia is fatally wounded, and the search for the next Akobi begins.

The divine continuance of Akshah collapses, Hehtan loses his divine power. He continues to live, for he is now a saranath. He uses Gate magic to retreat to the depths of the cold world—the place where dark magic found its birth: Tarralume, and the places in the world where the rime never melts. He recovers the Andolem Well in the ruins of Ithalas, Indofi, and perhaps other Anariima artifacts.

29,700 BBT—Relic Gate dark ages plateau.

29,694 BBT—The end.

What happens next?
Climatic change equilibrates in ~1,000 years. During this time, massive glacial advance is followed by steady glacial advance over the following 3.5 kyr, preventing any significant divine continuances forming during this time. The low climatic inertia of 25,000 BBT marks the bottom of the dark ages. Recovery begins here. After this point, practically 5000 years separates the new rising civilizations from the highpoints of the old world. Significant technological complexity and social complexity must be rebuilt. Probably to the base of the iron age as a rule of thumb, with recovery taking ~2000 years to begin a new Archaic-Classical age. This time, though, magic is already developed, though its complexity must be rediscovered  / recompiled for many cases. There is a slow climb out of the dark ages, as population must return and divine continuances must set in.
	Around 24,000 Victory binds with Selor and Lineament cults begin to grow as both Asfalonic and Artifexian beings exist to fight. This is some loud event...
	Mighty empires rise again by 22000.
	17k, Revelation becomes an artifact.
	15K Grace turns into Kalma, begins his empire. First crusade era!
	Kalma’s empire revolutionizes the world
	Swift collapse of Kalma’s medieval empire
	Late medieval era by 13,500 BBT.
	
	
	

29,000 BBT—Within the chaos of the dark ages, some mages of Uramuhj? seek to escape, using Gate magic to open a portal to Arangil, beginning planar exploration.

26,500 BBT—The Spiral is discovered; Last and First City is founded. Humanity is introduced to Asfalon.

25,000 BBT—The glacial period reaches its height.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------

There, in a deep and shadowed place, Kataghrah performed a forsaken ritual to summon the Heavenly Gate, the doorway to the land of the Evil Gods. The ritual finishes and the doorway appears in the stone, slowly opening and revealing the corporeal forms of the Evil Gods, waiting to step into the mortal world. The Evil Gods were vile beings, misshapen and malevolent. As the first of the Evil Gods steps into the world, Kataghrah and Hehtan spring their trap. Kataghrah completes a powerful protective ritual to bind the Evil Gods in blood-red crystal, pulling the powers of several Arihan around him to do so. Several Evil Gods succumb to the magic and are captured, but in the aftermath a battle breaks out between the Arihan and the Evil Gods and their monsters. Kataghrah is slain, along with much of the rest of the war party. The slaughter was not one-sided, however, as a number of the Evil Gods were destroyed as well. Hehtan slew the being that had laid-low the god-king, and the witnesses to this act named him Adhriguh, “Heavenly God Killer”. Hehtan and several of his honor guard escaped, taking with them a number of cinnabar crystals holding the imprisoned gods. In killing an evil god with the Thief Blade, Hehtan shifted the beliefs of those around him: they now believed that he himself was a manifestation of a deity. In the aftermath, Hehtan’s power grew as he reached apotheosis as Adhriguh, “God, Killer of Gods”. Adhriguh’s apotheosis was felt throughout all Akshah and beyond, as the clouds took shapes from his mind—skulls, writhing faces, and dying gods.
	The skies darkened over the crystal forest as the Evil Gods crept from their realm into the mortal world. The Heavenly Gate War had begun in Akshahya.
	



Sthih, a god of famine and drought
the most vile three: the God of Monsters, the God of Ruin, the God of Discord.
The Evil Gods corrupt the minds of mortals. First they reach only through Akshah, but with the Heavenly Gate open they are free to roam the world. Their influence is slowly felt in Tellin and across the mountains.
Physically, the Gate to the realm of the Evil Gods

Hehtan Adhriguh reconquers all of Akshahya and beyond, forging a new great empire. He creates a new university for magic, the Order of the Red Warlocks. The Order pushes philosophy (though not always that of Hehtan…), alchemy, theology, and ritual-writing. The Trapped God is kept by Hehtan in a cinnabar gemstone. Hehtan brings the war with the Evil Gods to a height at the end of this time, causing the eruption that destroys the known world…
	-Magic is greatly developed through this time. Rituals expand from simply being protection based. New forms of magic: enchantment (smiths), necromancy, advanced abjuration spells, evocation type spells, etc. The rituals are still long, extensive, and tied to deities, ie still Vancian. Maybe the “permission” evolves to be passive?
 


------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
Akshahya is the center of an upcoming simifix. Evil Gods roam the land, proto-mages are emerging as powerful forces. Over the next 3000 years, wars rage throughout Akshahya. Arihan and Tah-Galin lead armies of sword-wielding soldiers clad in feathers, laminar, and iron-age steel plate. Chariots kick up blood-red dust and sacrosanct rituals are carried out in hushed shadows by Red Warlocks. Building up to the simifix, Akshahya sees the rise of and fall of states that try to unify in the face of catastrophe. Some cities are wiped off the face of the world by armies of monsters. Some mortals capitulate to the whispers of the Evil Gods. Entire cities fall to the shadows.
	It was these wars that drove the advance of magic. Theologians turn to polymaths, developing mathematics, alchemy, and philosophy in pursuit of a way to control magical power.

	The simifix spreads to encompass all of Nomenes. Evil Gods cross the mountains to the west into Thandairia. Red Warlocks act as heralds of the apocalypse as monsters crawl from Nos Mori. They bring their power, enchanted weapons, and their cult. The first Red Warlock came to the capitol of the Shaasakid Empire around 32,100. They were untrusted and shunned—until Saksugon was killed by an Evil God in 32,021. Some factions—mainly Shaasakid loyalists and those that adopted Eastern Yayur culture—shunned and feared the Red Warlock, believing they assassinated the empress. Others, such as the Western Yayurs and Huromans, saw the Red Warlock as a true prophet. Thus, the collapse of the Shaasakid Empire was complicated by the beginning Heavenly Gate War. Some cities distrusted the Akshani cultists, others embraced them. The cities continued to trade and bicker and fight midst the slow darkening of the world. Nos Mori, more than Akshah, was the scene of rulers corrupted by the whispers of the Evil Gods. Monsters lurked in the forests and mountains around cities pressured to adapt if they wanted to survive. In this environment of impending war and Evil Gods, cities developed a stamped standardized coinage. They began to philosophize about the nature of the world, magic, and politics. The first democracies and republics grew from the Shaasakid foundations in order to fight against the growing doom. The Shukunene cities of the north coast of Huroma developed new and complex judicial systems. Cities banded together and alliances fell apart in betrayal. By 30,500 the Nos Mori was a complex political mess set upon by foreign gods. It entered an all-out war, the war that awakened the manyfold ancestor sevakath sleeping quietly in their crypts, waiting for the final war that was prophesied.

	The war in Nos Mori was not the last symptom of the simifix. By this time the climate had shifted such that waves of Jur-Hudai were forced to migrate north to escape the advancing glaciers and ice sheets. The forests were freezing, drying, and dying. The Jur-Hudai swept into the lands of the Zarrakaya in massive hordes tens of thousands strong. They fought with the mound-city peoples who had just recently adopted ironworking from Sor’haya traders. Thousands were killed. Many Zarrakaya were forced from their cities as their homes were sacked. Some mound tombs held out, and the Jur-Hudai broke upon them like waves in a storm, circling the formidable defenses and continuing their unstoppable journey northward. Some Zarrakaya fled to the spirit world, where they were slowly corrupted by their own fear. In many cases, Zarrakaya joined the hordes of migrant-raiders fleeing from the cold and dark. Hordes moved into Velkata first. Then north into Thandairia. They moved north along the westward side of Azaherem, reaching Akshahya from its southeastern corner. The Southerners were a third party in the simifix. They brought with them their culture, their One God, their Spirit World, their grovewalkers, their minds easily corrupted unto Evil and easily swayed to good by the Red Warlocks.
