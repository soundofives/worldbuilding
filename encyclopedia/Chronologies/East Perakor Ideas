    Perserek. Per perta. Mear. Sereg. Serek. Yor. Perayor, Persereg. Pertayor Periar. Periur. Peresta Perya

Peresek! (Half blood) nah, Attasek (Two Bloods)

These are the first "High Elves", "Chromatic Elves", etc.

The Attasek come from:
    Astar: tribal theocracy, PIE-esque, matron-led animist
    Akh: city-state magocracy, Egypt-esque, dualistic polytheism, reincarnation

Attasek culture at 45k:
    (after Apythia's ritual)
    Combination: city-state, theocracy (no magocracy possible. Maybe combination; theocracy by divine ritual power?), Egypt-esque, matron-led dualistic polytheism, reincarnation

Inspiration:
    Architecture: Minoan / Egyptian
    Clothing: Minoan
    Culture: Warlike

The waith accepted rule by the powerful. They were a magocracy, though this could easily have been an autocracy or monarchy. The mages ruled under divine right by the deities.
