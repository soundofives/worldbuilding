The Akh and astar in Lunima mix, and by the time civiliations begin to grow, the hybrid:

--------------------
    Perserek. Per perta. Mear. Sereg. Serek. Yor. Perayor, Persereg. Pertayor Periar. Periur. Peresta Perya

Peresek! (Half blood) nah, Attasek (Two Bloods)
--------------------

These are the first "High Elves", "Chromatic Elves", etc.

The Attasek come from:
    Astar: tribal theocracy, PIE-esque, matriarchy animist, afterlife
    Akh: city-state divine-right magocracy, Egypt-esque, dualistic polytheism, reincarnation

Attasek culture at 45k:
    (after Apythia's ritual)
    Combination: city-state, theocracy, Minoan-PIE-esque, matron-led dualistic polytheism, reincarnation

Inspiration:
    Architecture: Minoan / Egyptian
    Clothing: Minoan (summer), PIE furs (winter)
    Culture: Warlike

The waith accepted rule by the powerful. They were a magocracy, though this could easily have been an autocracy or monarchy. The mages ruled under divine right by the deities.
In a time after the end of the Usada, where refugees mix to form a new culture, that of the charcolithic Attasek in Lunima.

While the waith of Metimacopa before the Usada used bronze tools, the tin from Uruzil was halted with the city's destruction. The Akh reverted to copper tools, and this is what the Attasek used. During these early charcolithic times, the groups dispersed into tribal bands and moved across Lunima. The tribes fought over food and territory, though slowly the waith and astar interbred. After a few millenia, a middle-aged atta of Akh and their tribe settled into a fort-like village as a defensible position against other nearby tribes. Artha Tarascar.

With the founding of Artha Tarascar, the next millennia see more forts and villages in the north-west of Lunima. As the population of this region grows, the people also intermix more and more until they are a practically undifferentiated population of waith-astar. They call themselves the "Attasek".
