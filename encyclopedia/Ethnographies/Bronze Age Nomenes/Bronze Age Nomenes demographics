Lots of stuff to keep track of, but they're all pretty interconnected here.

Main civilizations:

-Total Jir-Elesin and Suhairians: 9e6. 6.1Mm of Jir-Elesin w/ density 3; 0.4Mm of Suhairian w/ density 12.
Akshani
Jir-Elesin
Suhairian kingdoms

The Akshani, after the first 1000 years, have a large population spike due to the fertile soils of the Samisah. Their migrations continued for 1000 years, and their natural growth increased to 0.06/100. This brings it to a total to 0.14/100 for the next 1000 years!
At 38,948 BBT: pop 1.1e6 over 0.57 Mm, density of 5/sq mile
After an additional 2000 years of growth (until 36948) with a growth rate of 0.06/100, the population of Akshan is 3.6e6 with a density of 13 over 0.72 Mm
By 35,600 (1348 years) with growth rate of 0.06/100, population of Akshah is 8e6! Density of 29 over 0.72 Mm.

The Suhairian Kingdoms, immediatly after the collapse, 38,300. Area ~0.8 Mm, population of 6e6. Density of 19 / sq mile!
By 37000: 0.05/100 growth rate due to violence, 11.5e6 over 1.25 Mm (expanded down east and west coasts). Density around 24/sq mile!



-Total Usvajrans: 11.6e6 over 2.4Mm, density ~12.5/sq mile.
Naga cults
Rajana tribes
Usvajran raiders
Nemorites

Eastern Yayurs
Western Yayurs

After 1500 years with an average growth rate of 0.06/100, a pretty good high for sacrificial and warring states of this technological level, the Later Thandairian cultures reach their pop saturation of 30/sq mile. Total pop is 28e6 over 2.4 Mm. Once this population saturation is reached, the civilizations are strained. Food shortages cause starvations, wars for resources increase. Religious sacrifices increase until population slows or stagnates.
At any given time, there tends to be <10 large or important population centers of the culture.

-Total Huromans: 10.6e6
Shukunenes
Omanusians
Marmans

-Total Savatumrans:
Savatumra
