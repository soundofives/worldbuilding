At its peak before the Early Bronze Age Collapse, the Savatumra culture was spread over ~6 Mm. This is at 41,700 BBT.

From its initiation around 46200 BBT, that region had a population ~5.7e6 with a density ~2.5/sq mile. Population growth spiked in the west and the population diffused throughout the region over the next 4500 years as farming spread along with the culture.
4500 years with average of 0.035/100 growth brings final Savatumra population to 27.5e6! They are a very populous people, but their wide region gives them a density of ~12/sq mile. The largest mounds are homes to over 6000 people, though the egalitarian culture continues to hold.

The EBAC brought with it acute climatic effects, but these were mainly staved off by the Savatumra divine continuance. Despite the protection of the divine continuance, it did cause famines and cooler winters in the tribal lands to the south of the Savatumra people, the lands of the ancient Vinaltakhans. This increased violence from the south and divided the Vinaltakhans and the Savatumrans further.

41,700 - 38900 BBT: 2800 years w/ average growth of 0.06 / 100. 8 Mm total now with expansion into Austera.
The total population of the Zarrakaya is 112 million!!! with density ~36 / sq mile. This is quite high. Perhaps population boom-bust cycles limits the growth. Instead of 0.06, the average growth is 0.04 / 100.
Better.
84e6 w/ density of 27 / sq mile. Largest city ~130,000 individuals.

The population of the Zarrakaya maxes out at around 100e6. This pushes the density to ~30 over 8.6 Mm, which is about as dense as I'm willing to go for a society of this technological level. What happens after this cap is reached?
People leave, they spread out. They begin pushing the boundaries of territory to find new fronteirs. This is the way especially for those born in Austera.
For those born in Nomenes, increase in violence balances population growth.
