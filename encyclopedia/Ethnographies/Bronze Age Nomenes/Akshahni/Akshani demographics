The Akshani began their time on the west coast of Samisah around 40,900. This is when the first settlers arrived, but the settlement of the area didn't stop until around 38,900.
With the initial 10,000 Ceris followers as a starting point, this migration can be modeled as a growth rate of 0.08/100 for 2000 years.
An aditional growth rate of 0.02 is added on to this to account for growth of the population already settled. A total growth rate of 0.1/100 for the first 1000 years.

After 1000 years, the population is 270,000. This first millennium is also when the Jivita dries and shifts, accounting for the small natural growth rate of 0.02/100. As this climatic flux ends, most of the Akshani around the mouth of the Jivita have diffused along the coasts to the north and east.
