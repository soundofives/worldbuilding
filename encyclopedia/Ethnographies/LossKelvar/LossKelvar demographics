At the onset of the Usada, there were around 100,000 Loss'kelvar. This is down around 99% from their pre-Usada levels.
The Loss'kelvar were also very scattered during this time.

73000 BBT
Pop 100000
Area ~ 42 Mm
Density ~0.006

This causes the growth rate to be abysmal, and on top of the low density the Usada is ravaging the world.

With 18000 years of very low growth rate (0.003/100) the population grows to 170000 Losskelvar over the same area.
Density ~0.01
This is a fair density for a recovering population at the end of a glacial period. Small pockets of this total area have more dense hunter-gatherer tribes, and most of the area is empty.

Over the next 25000 years (55k BBT to 30k BBT)
With slightly higher growth rate of 0.004
The Loss'kelvar pop grows to 466000 people.
Density ~0.029
Pretty good!
