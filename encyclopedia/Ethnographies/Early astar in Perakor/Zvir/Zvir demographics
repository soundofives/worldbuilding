The Zvir were smaller in number than the other migratory groups of the Davakrai diaspora. Their original bands numbered 100,000. They arrived in a hostile land, and population growth was low. Their tribes were spread out, though they developed a semi-uniform culture.

Over the first centuries, the Zvir spread themselves across the temperate zones of Solnaza; across the developing Mediterranean west coast, up the oceanic forests, into the eastern humid forests, and into the central steppes. 2.59 Mm with density 0.1.

Over the following 3500 years with a growth rate of 0.02/100, the Zvir numbered 200,000 and covered 5.2 Mm. This stretched teh Zvir over the entirety of northern Solnaza and through the eastern humid forests. They covered the cool northern part of the central desert, but the hostile wurms in the wastes slowed their expansion to the south. Their tribes surrounded the great southern lake and rounded the northern half of the western bay.

By this time, 38,000 BBT, their culture had fully developed, allowing their population to grow faster as it adapted to Solnaza's native inhabitants. After another two milennia with a growth rate of 0.025/100 and a density of 0.1, Zvir covered the entire continent and southern isle, around 8.6 Mm and 330,000 Zvir.

During this time (40,000 - 38,000) the Rhun migrants had been mixing with the Zvir. 100,000 Rhun came to Adasol, and their number grew to 116,000 at 38,000 BBT (growth rate 0.005/100). Adding their number to the Zvir, the population density is bumped to 0.13.

By 35,000 the population has risen to 1 million. This is enough to support divine continuances in each cultural region.

By 32,000 the population has risen to almost 2.7 million. This causes a sufficient density (a continental average of just below 1) to force civilization growth.
