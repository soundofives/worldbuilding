Initial population of 100,000 Piskiye. It's cold here, so not many settled here.
These people were agro-nomadic and liked river valleys. Over time, the initial 100,000 spread out over much of eastern and northern Ghelond, even beginning to spread through the mountain passes of the Vaults.

With density of 0.2, the 100,000 Piskiye cover 1.3 Mm.

38200 - After 3500 years with a growth rate of 0.025/100, the Piskiye grow to 240,000 and have grown to cover much of the Vault Sea territories. Soon enough, they are the dominant ethnic and cultural group of all northern Ghelond.
    dens ~0.33 / sq mile, 0.12 / sq km
Northern Ghelond can support a nomadic population of around 400,000 with a pop density of 0.5/sq mile, 1/sq km. Then they must spread beyond!

36200 - 2000 years w/ growth rate of 0.025/100 gets population to 400000. Population growth now goes into territory expansion.

With a growth rate of 0.025/100 and a pop pool of 4e5, 

32200 - 1e6 people will cover 5Mm with a density of 0.5/sq mile. An additional 4000 years brings this population! This is all of East Luazil, including the lush forests of the south (pop 100,000). Growth rate here increases, and culture changes. New cultures mature by this time in East Luazil, as the environment of the south is sufficiently different and traditions are forcibly different due to lack of whistling winds. Because of cultural divergence of East Luazil, new migrants from Ghelond don't fit in and no longer migrate away. Population pressure builds up!!! Violence increases! Sedentism is FORCED, and Piskiye culture in Gorasna changes.

New cultures: North + Central East are uniform, Central west + Central south + Foot North are uniform; Foot South is uniform.

29,700 BBT -------------
Foot South: agriculture adopted; growth rate increases to 0.04/100. Until the eruption (~2500 years). New pop: 270000, density of 1/sq mile, 0.38 /sq km over 0.66 Mm (spread to islands).

The rest of East Luazil has pop of 570000. Growth rate of 0.03/100 (more favorable environment).  1.2e6 at end, expands to cover 6Mm total! 3 Mm beyond East Luazil. This allows them to expand around the Luazil sea, and a little inland.
