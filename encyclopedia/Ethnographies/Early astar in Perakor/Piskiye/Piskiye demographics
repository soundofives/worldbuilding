Initial population of 100,000 Piskiye. It's cold here, so not many settled here.
These people were agro-nomadic and liked river valleys. Over time, the initial 100,000 spread out over much of eastern and northern Ghelond, even beginning to spread through the mountain passes of the Vaults.

With density of 0.2, the 100,000 Piskiye cover 1.3 Mm.

After 3500 years with a growth rate of 0.025/100, the Piskiye grow to 240,000 and have grown to cover much of the Vault Sea territories. Soon enough, they are the dominant ethnic and cultural group of all northern Ghelond.
