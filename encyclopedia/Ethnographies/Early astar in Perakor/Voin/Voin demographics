The Voin have a large initial population of 250,000 astar.
They are a mostly agrarian culture in oceanic forests and fertile islands. After clearing much of the island forests, the arable land allowed for swift population growth and concentration.

Initially, the Voin predecessors took up 0.3 Mm with a density of 2.

Because of the amount of land around them, the population density of the Voin doesn't need to greatly increase. Cities grow large, and after 3,500 years just over 1,000,000 Voin cover south Ghelond. From their original home in the east, they have covered the southern tip and have spread up the west coast to the large island outside the Vault Sea. They cover the oceanic coast inland of this island. With this, all of Ghelond is covered by astar!
