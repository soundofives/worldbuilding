The Voin have a large initial population of 250,000 astar.
They are a mostly agrarian culture in oceanic forests and fertile islands. After clearing much of the island forests, the arable land allowed for swift population growth and concentration.

Initially, the Voin predecessors took up 0.3 Mm with a density of 2.

Because of the amount of land around them, the population density of the Voin doesn't need to greatly increase. Cities grow large, and after 3,500 years (38,200 BBT) just over 1,000,000 Voin cover south Ghelond. (3500 years with growth rate 0.04/100, covering ~1.3 Mm with density 2) From their original home in the east, they have covered the southern tip and have spread up the west coast to the large island outside the Vault Sea. They cover the oceanic coast inland of this island. With this, all of Ghelond is covered by astar!

After another 3200 years (35,000 BBT) with a slower growth rate of 0.03/100, the Voin are more dense with the same area (~1.35 Mm at density 5, comperable to pre columbian united states). pop 2.6e6

After another 3000 years (32,000 BBT) with an even slower growth speed of 0.025/100 representing less available land, high density leading to more wars, etc, the Voin are at a population of 5.5e6! This leads to a population density of around 11. Cities form.
