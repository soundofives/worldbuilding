The Hoditi, over the first 3500 years of their cultural evolution, built up 200,000 nomadic members. These spread mostly over eastern Tepeheo and into the desert, slowly following the monsoon rains southward. Over the following 2200 years, their numbers increased to 390,000, and their tribes covered all of Tepeheo except those coasts claimed by the Yedris.
    This is will 0.03/100 growth rate consistently. Density ~0.3

After the next 1000 years (35,000 BBT), the population of Hoditi is around 500,000 at density around 0.4. Growth rate slowed to 0.025/100 due to running out of land.
