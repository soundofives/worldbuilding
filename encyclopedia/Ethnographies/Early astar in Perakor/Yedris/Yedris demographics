Initial population of 250,000 Yedris. The Yedris are pretty dense originally, owing to the agricultural fertility of their land. They lived in the Mediterranean river valleys around their peninsula and grew quickly--

42,000 BBT: At 0.04/100 rate for 3500 years, the Yedris grew to cover 1.3 Mm of coasts at a density of 2. This is enough to generally form powerful civilizations in the hearts of their cultural area. They expanded to cover the entire large peninsula, Zvezdayr, along with the coasts of the large bay/sea to the southwest. This includes a monsoonal river-valley civilization in the desert.

The Yedris also expanded through the Channel and the large Channel island.

By 37,000 BBT, the total Yedris population is around 5.6e6 with an average density of 8 and growth of 0.035/100 (slightly slower) and 1.86 Mm (slightly further down easternmost coast, filling in a bit further inland elsewhere). This allows for large cities, like Krinica at 36,000 people.

By 35,000 BBT, at the first fall of Krinica, population is at 10e6! The cities are very large.
