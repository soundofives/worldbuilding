Initial population of 250,000 Yedris. The Yedris are pretty dense originally, owing to the agricultural fertility of their land. They lived in the Mediterranean river valleys around their peninsula and grew quickly--

At 0.04/100 rate for 3500 years, the Yedris grew to cover 1.3 Mm of coasts at a density of 2. This is enough to generally form powerful civilizations in the hearts of their cultural area. They expanded to cover the entire large peninsula, Zvezdayr, along with the coasts of the large bay/sea to the southwest. This includes a monsoonal river-valley civilization in the desert.

The Yedris also expanded through the Channel and the large Channel island.
