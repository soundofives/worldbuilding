Around 42000 BBT, the Davakrai diaspora scattered the population of Lunima across Perakor.
The initial population was around 2 million--half of these left over the course of several hundred years, leaving Lunima with a population of 1 million.

At 41000 BBT:
Total area of Lunima: 1 Mm.
Total popuation: 1e6
Density: ~2.5

By 37000 BBT (4000 years later, slower 0.025 growth rate due to increased violence)
Pop: 2.7e6
Density: 7

This density is average: The south and east are less dense than the Mediterranean Medhyamoya region. This part is very dense, with large settlements.
Medhyamoya has approx area of 0.2 Mm, pop 1.5e6, density of 18. Kar-Esodhkar grows to 22,000 people.

The next 4000 years (37 -> 33000 BBT) are primarily without much technological growth. The Nikartian Empire comes to power and rules, and the east of Lunima grows more fertile.

33000 BBT, 4000 years with growth rate 0.025 (still pretty violent)
Pop: 7.38e6
Density: 18
Now almost all of Lunima grows as dense as Medhyamoya.
