After 800 years in Amarth, the Davakrai and Hiidkeil relationship stabilizes.
41700 - Initially, there were 300,000 Davakrai to migrated to Amarth.
40900 - At 0.02/100 growth rate due to conflicts, number is 350,000 Davakrai.
    At 0.6 population density, this puts the Davakrai at 1.5 Mm, the total coverage of easily arrable land in Amarth. After only 800 years, the Amarthian population slows its outward expansion and begins growing more and more dense.

After 3500 years (38,200) with a growth rate of 0.04 (more stable, less conflict with Hiidkeil, lots of land), population reaches 1.4 million Davakrai, possibly more with eventual interbreeding with locals over that time to lower generation time. This is when population density reaches around 2 for the whole region, allowing for larger cities to grow.

36,165. By the time of the collapse of Andesedabon, the total population of Davakrai and Abonkeil in Amarth had grown to 3.2 million. Around 550,000 lived in Andesedabon, 2.65 million across the rest of southern Amarth. After the collapse, almsot all of these 500,000 of these Abonkeil migrated away. Nikarta forced these people to remain east of the mountains in Tumyetos. Tumyetos, before this influx, had grown to a population of 570,000. The rest of southern Amarth had amassed 2,000,000 Davakrai at a population density of almost 5.
