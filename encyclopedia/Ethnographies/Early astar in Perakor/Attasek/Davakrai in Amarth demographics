After 800 years in Amarth, the Davakrai and Hiidkeil relationship stabilizes.
41700 - Initially, there were 300,000 Davakrai to migrated to Amarth.
40900 - At 0.02/100 growth rate due to conflicts, number is 350,000 Davakrai.
    At 0.6 population density, this puts the Davakrai at 1.5 Mm, the total coverage of easily arrable land in Amarth. After only 800 years, the Amarthian population slows its outward expansion and begins growing more and more dense.

After 3500 years with a growth rate of 0.04 (more stable, less conflict with Hiidkeil, lots of land), population reaches 1.4 million Davakrai, possibly more with eventual interbreeding with locals over that time to lower generation time. This is when population density reaches around 2 for the whole region, allowing for larger cities to grow.
