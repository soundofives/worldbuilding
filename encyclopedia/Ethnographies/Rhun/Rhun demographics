At the onset of the Usada, 200,000 Rhun survived around Rinadure. The Usada was a harsh time even for Waith, but their population grew to 500,000 by the end of the 18,000 years. (0.005/100 rate).

At this point, the Rhun were mostly living around cities. The next period sees slightly faster growth, 0.007 for 5000 years. This brings the population to 700000 by the time the cities collapse from the weight of the changing climate. The Rhun attempt to rebuilt their cities, but over the next few millennia more and more Rhun come to the realization that the changing climate will never allow them to live sedentary lives. The slow migration of Rhun commenses, and a total of 500,000 Rhun build the powerful ships of their people and sail from Rhunendor.
