At 44k BBT, there are 4.2 million people of the Tellin culture. Total area: 2.2Mm, density ~5/sq mile.

Up to this point, the average growth rate was 0.02/100. Now, with the advent of the Usvajra culture, larger scale agriculture, and social interactions between Huroma and Nomenes, the population growth rate spikes to 0.06/100.

There are 3000 years of growth until the early Bronze Age collapse around Nos Mori. During this time, growth is at 0.06/100
Pop at 40,948 BBT: 25e6! This skyrockets the population density to 30 / sq mile on average. This aids in the developing urbanization of the region. Okos reaches a population of 85,000!


Total population of large urban centers: 170,000. 60% die in the collapse. Total rural population: 24,830,000. 15% die swiftly in the collapse, then a growth rate of -0.01/100 grips the Tellin culture for the next 2000 years.
