	\normalfont Spoken Language: dia. Wesaxian (mod. PIA)$\rightarrow$ Eyasolic by 34,200 BBT 
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (centralized theocracy, horticulturalist, decentralized animist-polytheistic, spirit-binding magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The Eyasolian magic uses some spirits to bind others to objects and people, allowing the spirit to share or control the new form.}
	@@ \textsc{\textbf{Proto Huroman}}

	\normalfont Spoken Language: Proto-Huroman (PIE+PIA+Bangala)
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (gerontocracy, fishing horticultural, animist \& ancestor worship, health magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: Proto-Huroman magic takes a `witch-doctor' like focus, with tribal practitioners supplicating spirits for healing, cures, and curses. They also supplicate their ancestors for guidance and guardianship.}
	@@@ \textsc{\textbf{Nomadic Huroman}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: Huroman (PIA+Bangala) by 48,800 BBT
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (egalitarian, mercantile \& hunter-gatherer, animist, centralized health magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The more mature nomadic Huromans, living primarily in the north, central, and dry southeast, practice a more consolidated form of the health magic of their ancestors. Rather than a single witch-doctor from any tribe being able to supplicate to the spirits, these nomads now require a gestalt of tribal spiritualists to work together. The mercantile and social nature of these nomads brings them generally closer than others, making these gestalts not incredibly rare.}
	@@@ \textsc{\textbf{Coastal Huroman}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: Huroman (PIA+Bangala) by 48,800 BBT
	
	Written Language: Huroman logographic
	
	Morphology: (monarchical, horticultural \& slavery, distributed polytheistic [social, nature], decentralized health magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The coastal Huromans are a settled culture with a separation between the religious authorities and state authorities, making them one of the most progressive cultures around in this respect. The decentralized and heirarchical nature of Huroman Dzers allows more levels of society to access supplication rituals.}
	@@ \textsc{\textbf{Proto Eastern}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: Proto-Eastern (PIE + Indo-Iranian)
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (tribal egalitarian, hunter-gatherer, animist \& ancestor worship, decentralized ancestor magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The Proto-Easterners were a widely nomadic people practicing local and cosmic animism with the addition of tribal ancestral guardians. The primary goal of their spiritual supplication was on these ancestral guardians, which were manifested in fetish objects carried by the tribes.}
	@@@ \textsc{\textbf{Ghahakan}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: Ghahakan (PIE + mod. Indo-Iranian) by 47,500 BBT
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (chiefdom, hunter-gatherer \& pastoral, centralized polytheism \& ancestor worship, centralized ancestor magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The Ghahakans call upon spirits and deities to gather the spirits of the dead in regional monoliths.}
	@@@ \textsc{\textbf{North Samisian}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: dia. Proto-Eastern (PIE + mod. Indo-Iranian) %North Samisian (mod. Indo-Iranian + Ossetic)
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (tribal egalitarian, fishing horticultural, pseudopolytheism \& ancestor worship, nature magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: These early inhabitants of the Suhairi region called upon local nature gods for the main purpose of natural preservation.}

	\normalfont Spoken Language: dia. Proto-Eastern (PIE + mod. Indo-Iranian) %North Samisian (mod. Indo-Iranian + Ossetic)
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (chiefdom, hunter-gatherer, pseudopolytheism \& ancestor worship, nature magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: Formed from the mixing of North Samisian refugees forced from the coast by Nlashikir, the Sakula took up different subsistence strategies, tribal organization, religion, and magic from their ancestors. They were far more violent.}
	@@@ \textsc{\textbf{East Samisian}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: East Samisian (mod. Indo-Iranian + Kurdish) from 48,300 BBT
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (chiefdom, hunter-gatherer \& pastoral, decentralized pseudopolytheist, decentralized ancestor magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: Territorial totems imbued with ancestral spirits similar to but more decentralized than Ghahakan monoliths}
	@@@@ \textsc{\textbf{Gairiatic}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: dia. Proto-Eastern (PIE + mod. Indo-Iranian)
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (egalitarian, hunter-gatherer, decentralized pseudopolytheist, spirit-tree magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The Gairians lived in generally smaller, more egalitarian groups than their ancestral Samisians. They were exclusively hunter-gatherers and fishers, and believed in unique local anthropomorphized spirits. The Gairians continued to make totems like their ancestors, though these totems acted as houses and conduits for spirits rather than ancestral guardians. Additionally, the totems were always carved from trees. Tribes would create totems for important spirits, and any tribe could supplicate to that totem to gain the spirits boons or use it to curse others. Generally, supplication was used for social and natural ends.}
	@@@@ \textsc{\textbf{Darungian}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: dia. East Samisian (mod. Indo-Iranian + Kurdish)
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (egalitarian, hunter-gatherer, decentralized animist, decentralized ancestor mask-magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The totems of their East Samisian ancestors shrank personal masks worn by important tribal members. The masks were imbued with ancestral power, like the totems from which they were derived.}
	@@@ \textsc{\textbf{Vinaltakhan}}
	
	\normalfont Spoken Language: Proto-Eastern (PIE + mod. Indo-Iranian) until 38,800 BBT
	
	Written Language: N/A
	
	Morphology: (egalitarian, hunter-gatherer, pantheist, \& ancestor worship, spirit-line social magic)
	
	{\footnotesize Notes: The Vinaltakh cultures practiced a unique form of animism and magic. They believed that, rather than the ancestral animistic belief of all things having spirits, all things exist as part of a single spirit. This single spirit, one with the material world itself, is marked by spiritual trails and sites. Supplication can allow tribes to communicate or travel along these spiritual lines, and general supplication goes towards sustaining this network.}
