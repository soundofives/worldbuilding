The genetic code is specified by the four nucleotide ^letters^ A (adenine), C (cytosine), T (thymine), and G (guanine). SNP variation occurs when a single nucleotide, such as an A, replaces one of the other three nucleotide lettersC, G, or T.\n\nAn example of a SNP is the alteration of the DNA segment AAGGTTA to ATGGTTA, where the second ^A^ in the first snippet is replaced with a ^T^. On average, SNPs occur in the human population more than 1 percent of the time. Because only about 3 to 5 percent of a person's DNA sequence codes for the production of proteins, most SNPs are found outside of ^coding sequences^. SNPs found within a coding sequence are of particular interest to researchers because they are more likely to alter the biological function of a protein. Because of the recent advances in technology, coupled with the unique ability of these genetic variations to facilitate gene identification, there has been a recent flurry of SNP discovery and detection.", "2010-11-02 21:42:20"

"Info 1",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more unstructured dates. An unstructured date is a date specified in free text. E.g., ^Beginning of 1969^ is an unstructured date, whereas ^Jan 1969^ is a structured date. Unstructured dates are permitted in a GEDCOM file. However, in many cases they indicate that a date field was abused for other information, e.g. to specify a place or a fact not related to a date. Sometimes an unstructured date is simply a valid date with some spelling mistake. The main drawback of unstructured dates is that they cannot be sorted or queried because they cannot be compared to other dates."
"Info 10",                      "The GEDCOM file contains one or more photos with a missing file."
"Info 101",                     "The GEDCOM file did not specify its encoding, but had special characters in the range 128-255 that indicate that some encoding was used. This characterizes GEDCOM files produced by outdated Genealogy applications. If you see gibberish letters in the data, please use the Encoding Override import option and try to match the encoding used in the file."
"Info 102",                     "The GEDCOM file uses a non-standard encoding which is not recognized, and it has special characters in the range 128-255 that indicate that some encoding was used. If you see gibberish letters in the data, please use the Encoding Override import option and try to match the encoding used in the file."
"Info 103",                     "The GEDCOM file uses the ambiguous codec ^IBMPC^ which is forbidden by the GEDCOM specification because it does not indicate whether it uses a DOS or Windows character set. If you see gibberish letters in the data, please try the Encoding Override import option and try to match the encoding used in the file."
"Info 104",                     "The GEDCOM file has a header but no trailer. This indicates that the file is probably incomplete, perhaps due to a problem that occurred during the transmission of the file."
"Info 105",                     "The GEDCOM file has an invalid ANSEL sequence. This is the usually the result of partial damage to the GEDCOM file, that led to a portion of it getting overwritten, or a problem in the Genealogy application that created this GEDCOM file."
"Info 106",                     "The GEDCOM file has an invalid Unicode sequence. This is the usually the result of partial damage to the GEDCOM file, that led to a portion of it getting overwritten, or a problem in the Genealogy application that created this GEDCOM file."
"Info 107",                     "The GEDCOM file contains letters that cannot be displayed in the selected language. Such letters will be substituted with a question mark."
"Info 108",                     "The GEDCOM file contains at least one missing mutual reference. A missing mutual reference is a scenario in which one record, such as a Person or a Family, points to another record, but the other record does not point back. Missing mutual references are automatically fixed during the import process."
"Info 2",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more non-standard custom events. A non-standard custom event is a GEDCOM event associated with a person or family, that was apparently entered manually, e.g., ^Struck by lightning^. Such events are fine, but because they are unpredictable, this application will not be able to automatically translate them to other languages, unlike many standard events for which multiple translations are provided."
"Info 3",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more unrecognized records. An unrecognized record is a record that is not part of the GEDCOM specification and is probably proprietary to the Genealogy application that produced the GEDCOM file. The use of such records is discouraged. Unrecognized records cannot be imported because their meaning and internal structure are not published."
"Info 4",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more reused indexes. An index that is used more than once, is a GEDCOM index that is incorrectly associated with more than one record. This is a result of a problem in the Genealogy application that produced the GEDCOM file. The import will only be able to pick up one record associated with an index; other records that use the same index cannot be imported."
"Info 5",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more indexes that are referenced but not defined. An index that is referenced but not defined, is an index that is used within the GEDCOM file to point to a record, but that record is incorrectly not defined within the GEDCOM file. This is a result of a problem in the Genealogy application that produced the GEDCOM file. Such indexes are erased during the import process because they are invalid."
"Info 6",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more bad pointers. A bad pointer in a GEDCOM file is a string of text, in a location designated by the GEDCOM specification for a pointer, that is not enclosed in '@' characters as required by the specification. This usually means that the Genealogy application that produced the GEDCOM file strays from the GEDCOM specification."
"Info 7",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more invalid lines. An invalid line is a line of content in the GEDCOM file that does not adhere to the GEDCOM specification and cannot be interpreted. Such lines might occur in a GEDCOM file that has been partially damaged, or indicate a problem in the Genealogy application that produced the GEDCOM file."
"Info 8",                       "The GEDCOM file contains one or more unrecognized tags. An unrecognized tag is a field that does not adhere to the GEDCOM specification. Some unrecognized tags are proprietary to specific Genealogy applications and their use is permitted. This application will import them, but may not be able to use them according to the exact intent of the application that produced them due to their proprietary nature. Other unrecognized tags are standard GEDCOM tags that are simply used incorrectly, in the wrong place or in the wrong way. This, unfortunately, is a common malady of many Genealogy applications. Most typical and common application-specific errors are anticipated by this application and fixed automatically. Those that are reported are not fixed, but are converted to notes if this option is selected in the import wizard."
