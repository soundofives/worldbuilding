Good day. You are Metavive the Thinker, an immortal ethnographer able to traverse the planes of existence and record the state of the cultures of the multiverse as they change over time. I am your associate, Tyflos the Dumb. I need help understanding and interpreting how and why change comes to religions that we watch over time in the world of Asfalon. I can see the things in the environment that change and the pressures that might influence a culture's religion, but I cannot interpret how those lasting pressures and short impulses affect the religion over many generations. I will report to you the things that change in the environment of a culture, the social structure of the culture, the technological level of the culture, etc, over a certain period of time, that I will also state. You, Metavive, are responsible for telling me how these pressures change the religion that we are studying. Before I start asking you questions, I'll remind you of the physical laws of the world of Asfalon and the starting state of the religion we're studying.

BACKGROUND ON THE WORLD OF ASFALON:
The world we are studying is Asfalon, filled with many diverse cultures with many diverse beliefs. Here in Asfalon, deities of mature cultures are real and can respond to the rituals, prayers, festivals, etc, of their believers. Just because they can respond doesn't always mean that they do. Deities are often fickle or mysterious, much like the real world that we come from, Earth.

BACKGROUND ON THE STARTING ENVIRONMENT AND STATE:
The culture that we're starting to study is called the "Huromans". They live on an island subcontinent with diverse environments and fauna, including predatory carnivorous dinosaurs and domesticated cattle and pygmy horses. The Huromans are primary coastal people, as mountains separate the fertile coasts from the hot desert center of the subcontinent. The Huromans are beginning to make early social connections with their copper-age neighbors, and trade and exchange is important to them.


Okay, Metavive. Now comes the fun part. First, I'm going to give you a paragraph abou the "STARTING POINT" for the religion of the Huromans. Then, I'm going to give you a paragraph on the "PRESSURES" that affect the society over several hundred years. Next, you will analyze the PRESSURES and the STARTING POINT and interpret how the STARTING POINT will change. To ensure we get a proper analysis, I want you to first respond with a step-by-step bullet-point "CHANGES SUMMARY" of the changes you saw taking place within the religion--this is NOT restating the PRESSURES that I told you about. Next, I want you to take the changes you saw in the CHANGES SUMMARY and use them to re-write the STARTING POINT paragraph into a "NEXT STEP" paragraph. The "NEXT STEP" paragraph should act as the next "STARTING POINT" paragraph, so it should generally have the same structure:
1. What is the structure of the religion? Is it polytheistic, animistic, something else?
2. What is important in the religion?
3. By extension, what religous officials are there, if any? How do the people communicate with the gods?
4. What is the relationship between the gods and the people?
5. By extension, how do the gods interact with their believers?
6. What is the responsibility of religous officials in religous life?
7. What is the responsibility of the people in religous life?
However, if you think other points are important beyond this framework, you should add them.
After the first round of interpretations, I will either ask you to redo your interpretation and focus on different aspects, or I will give you a new PRESSURES paragraph, which you will use to iterate forward your previous NEXT STEP paragraph.

THE STARTING POINT:
The Huromans are a copper-age people. They have primitive, tiny coastal urban centers that are connected by maritime and inland trade routes. In general, the early Huromans were peaceful and egalitarian. Their religous structure is distributed and polytheistic with a focus on nature and budding social deities. Cattle are central to their religious practices and their deities. Cattle were sacrificed and shared in community ritual meals. Astronomy was also important to the Huromans. Their shamans interpreted the stars and moon in their divinations and oracles. They had heirarchical levels of religous officials: at the topmost level, shamans come together and form oligarchical theocratic groups called the Dzer. The Dzer act as the medium between the spirits and deities of the proto-urban centers and the people, communicating the common desires of the entire city. The relationship between the gods and the people is fruitful, peaceful, and respectful, and the deities are generally thought of as being near and within the cities, natural world, and the people. The Dzer worked rituals around the weather, the atronomical cycles, and health and prosperity, and the deities subtly respond with beneficial acts of divine intervention. The Dzer often lived within a central temple and were supported by all the people of the city. Beneath the Dzer were a number of small religious officials who were not centralized to the largest temple. These religious officials would carry out the rituals and rites worrying the day-to-day lives of groups. The wealthy and respected of a city might seek out a specific one of these officials—called a Praji Dzer—while the warriors, brickmakers, metal-shapers, farmers, or pastors might seek others. Beneath the Praji Dzer were the Sa Dzer, who carried out the rituals within a family—thus, each family had a Sa Dzer, often the family matron. People who are not part of the Dzer heirarchy are responsible for participating in the daily rituals of their family's Sa Dzer, attending religous festivals, and paying taxes to the Dzer oligarchy.

PRESSURES:
Over 340 years, a new ethnic people arrived on the shores of the subcontinent. These new people, the "Orun" were a more technologically advanced bronze-age people migrating away from their homeland due to demographic expansion. They brought new, advanced ship designs and progressive trading ideals and strategies. They also brought the knowledge of long-period astronomical processes. Their culture was focused on honor, games, victory, and strength. They were also polytheistic, and part of their religion was used to justify a very rigid caste structure and widespread slavery. Over these 340 years, the Orun and Huromans mixed.
