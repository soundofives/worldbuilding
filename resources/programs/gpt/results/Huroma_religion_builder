THE STARTING POINT:
The Huromans are a copper-age people. They have primitive, tiny coastal urban centers that are connected by maritime and inland trade routes. In general, the early Huromans were peaceful and egalitarian. Their religous structure is distributed and polytheistic with a focus on nature and budding social deities. Cattle are central to their religious practices and their deities. Cattle were sacrificed and shared in community ritual meals. Astronomy was also important to the Huromans. Their shamans interpreted the stars and moon in their divinations and oracles. They had heirarchical levels of religous officials: at the topmost level, shamans come together and form oligarchical theocratic groups called the Dzer. The Dzer act as the medium between the spirits and deities of the proto-urban centers and the people, communicating the common desires of the entire city. The relationship between the gods and the people is fruitful, peaceful, and respectful, and the deities are generally thought of as being near and within the cities, natural world, and the people. The Dzer worked rituals around the weather, the atronomical cycles, and health and prosperity, and the deities subtly respond with beneficial acts of divine intervention. The Dzer often lived within a central temple and were supported by all the people of the city. Beneath the Dzer were a number of small religious officials who were not centralized to the largest temple. These religious officials would carry out the rituals and rites worrying the day-to-day lives of groups. The wealthy and respected of a city might seek out a specific one of these officials—called a Praji Dzer—while the warriors, brickmakers, metal-shapers, farmers, or pastors might seek others. Beneath the Praji Dzer were the Sa Dzer, who carried out the rituals within a family—thus, each family had a Sa Dzer, often the family matron. People who are not part of the Dzer heirarchy are responsible for participating in the daily rituals of their family's Sa Dzer, attending religous festivals, and paying taxes to the Dzer oligarchy.

PRESSURES:
Over 340 years, a new ethnic people arrived on the shores of the subcontinent. These new people, the "Orun" were a more technologically advanced bronze-age people migrating away from their homeland due to demographic expansion. They brought new, advanced ship designs and progressive trading ideals and strategies. They also brought the knowledge of long-period astronomical processes. Their culture was focused on honor, games, victory, and strength. They were also polytheistic, and part of their religion was used to justify a very rigid caste structure and widespread slavery. Over these 340 years, the Orun and Huromans mixed.

NEXT STEP:
The Huromans, a copper-age people, have encountered the technologically advanced Orun culture over the course of 340 years. As the two cultures mixed, the Huroman religion underwent significant changes while still maintaining its polytheistic and nature-focused structure. Influenced by the Orun's advanced ship designs and progressive trading ideals, the Huromans embraced new concepts of maritime commerce, expanding their coastal urban centers and establishing more extensive trade routes. Alongside these developments, the Huromans assimilated the Orun's knowledge of long-period astronomical processes, which played a crucial role in their divinations and oracles, enhancing their understanding of celestial events. However, the profound impact of the Orun culture extended beyond mere knowledge exchange. The Huromans found themselves captivated by the Orun's focus on honor, games, victory, and strength. These values began permeating their religious beliefs, reshaping the hierarchy of the faith. The once egalitarian religious structure became influenced by the Orun's rigid caste system, leading to a transformation of the oligarchical theocratic groups known as the Dzer. Each Dzer now aligned with specific castes, with different responsibilities assigned to uphold the religious and social order. Consequently, the perception of deities among the Huromans started to shift, intertwining with the Orun's polytheistic beliefs. New gods emerged, or existing deities underwent modifications, reflecting the social hierarchy and values of honor, victory, and strength. The role of the religious officials adapted to incorporate elements of the Orun's practices, incorporating ceremonies and rituals centered around honor, games, and competition. Communication with the gods entailed invoking or appeasing them through specific rites associated with these new aspects. The Huromans' religious life, previously centered around nature and communal rituals, now incorporated elements of competition, personal achievements, and striving for excellence. Within this evolving landscape, the Dzer took on additional responsibilities, not only preserving the religious traditions but also reinforcing the caste system inherited from the Orun culture. The people's participation in religious life encompassed not only daily rituals but also ceremonies celebrating honor, games, and victory. As the Huromans embraced the influences of the Orun culture, their religion underwent a profound transformation, paving the way for a new phase in their spiritual journey.

PRESSURES:
Over the next 450 years the combined Huroman-Orun civilization grew in population and technical capability (entering the Bronze-Age) before they underwent a societal collapse due to a distant volcanic eruption. The eruption caused a wave of refugees, migrants, and roving war parties to invade their land, settle, and impose their own cultural ideals over the course of a long dark age. The newcomers, called the "Yayurs", were another bronze-age society and former neighbor. They formed small city-states controlled by a matriarchal theocratic elite on the islands off the coast of the subcontinent. They were polytheistic, with a heavy reliance on human sacrifice, blood rituals, and the afterlife. Their religion featured huge, extravagent city-wide rituals, and large religous architecture. They were a people with emergine ideals of individualism.

Note, these pressures do not need to completely change the Huroman-Orun religion if you believe some components are incompatible. This could lead to tensions in the history of the Huroman-Orun and the Yayur peoples.


NEXT STEP:
In the aftermath of the societal collapse caused by a distant volcanic eruption, the Huroman-Orun civilization faced a significant upheaval with the arrival of the Yayurs, a bronze-age society driven by their polytheistic beliefs and matriarchal theocratic elite. As the Yayurs settled on the islands off the coast, they exerted their influence over the land, challenging the existing religious practices. The Huroman-Orun religion, now influenced by the Yayur culture, experienced a clash of beliefs and ideals, leading to tensions and a complex interplay between the two peoples. While the fundamental polytheistic structure remained intact, the introduction of human sacrifice, blood rituals, and a strong focus on the afterlife brought new dimensions to the Huroman-Orun belief system. The once nature-centered rituals and communal practices were now interwoven with large-scale, extravagant city-wide rituals and imposing religious architecture, mirroring the Yayur influence. The matriarchal theocratic elite of the Yayurs disrupted the existing hierarchical structure of the Dzer, introducing their own power dynamics and relegating certain religious officials to subordinate roles. This shift resulted in a renegotiation of the relationship between the gods and the people, with the Yayur emphasis on individualism further challenging the collective nature of the Huroman-Orun religion. While tensions arose between the traditions of the Huroman-Orun and the new influences, there were also instances of syncretism and cultural blending as the two societies intermingled. The religious landscape of the Huroman-Orun civilization entered a period of adaptation and conflict, marked by the simultaneous preservation of core beliefs and the incorporation of Yayur elements, shaping a unique syncretic expression of spirituality.

PRESSURES:
1000 years pass, over which time the cultures of the subcontinent grow demogrpahically to the point of saturation, which increases internal tensions, but also allows for new trade networks as more people cover the subcontinent and distant civilizations demand goods from maritime merchants. Towards the end of this 1000 year period, a distant empire, the "Shaasakid Dynasty", sweeps over the eastern half of the subcontinent and conquers it. The Shaasakids do not enforce their own religous ideals, but they do enforce a new political structure onto the people of the subcontinent. The local elective administrative bodies of the Shaasakids were implemented efficiently in practice throughout the Empire, as they did not necessarily rely on the presence of their own theocratic elite or even the conversion of the local area to the religion of the Eastern Yayurs to function. Shaasakids are religiously adoptive, encouraging local worship while also introducing Eastern Yayur deities and rituals through their distributed theocratic administrative system. The Shaasakids are less loose with their economic and civil controls. Coming from a palatial economic background, the local economies of trade were radically regulated and emplaced within a palacial system where the elected administrative official and their theocratic council controlled much of the wealth and trade. They enforced with economic transformation with a powerful military presence in conquered polities.



NEXT STEP:
After a millennium of growth and demographic saturation, the cultures of the subcontinent find themselves at a crossroads as the Shaasakid Dynasty sweeps over the eastern half, imposing a new political structure. While not enforcing their own religious ideals, the Shaasakids introduce a distributed theocratic administrative system that reshapes the religious landscape of the region. The once decentralized religious practices of the Huroman-Orun civilization now coexist with the incorporation of Eastern Yayur deities and rituals, driven by the Shaasakids' encouragement of local worship. The administrative bodies established by the Shaasakids, efficient in their functioning, transcend the need for conversion to the religion of the Eastern Yayurs, allowing for religious diversity to persist. However, the Shaasakids' tight control over economic and civil matters ushers in a new era of regulation and centralization. Local economies, once flourishing within trade networks, become subject to a palatial system where elected administrative officials and their theocratic councils hold significant power over wealth and trade. The enforcement of economic transformation is accompanied by a formidable military presence, solidifying the Shaasakids' authority in conquered polities. As a result, the Huroman-Orun religion experiences a further blending of beliefs and practices, with syncretism continuing to shape the evolving spirituality of the subcontinent.
